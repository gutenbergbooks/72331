  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Trochanters undivided; the hind-body consisting of from three to five visible
    segments; the female with an ovipositor, usually retracted, transversely segmented, enveloping a

  </div>

  <p>The Tubulifera form but a small group in comparison with Parasitica and Aculeata, the other two
  Series of the Sub-Order. Though of parasitic habits, they do not appear to be closely allied to
  any of the families of Hymenoptera Parasitica, though M. du Buysson suggests that they have some
  affinity with Proctotrypidae; their morphology and classification have been, however, but little
  discussed, and have not been the subject of any profound investigation. At present it is only
  necessary to recognise one family, viz. Chrysididae or Ruby-wasps.<a id="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> These Insects are usually of glowing, metallic colours, with a
  very hard, coarsely-sculptured integument. Their antennae are abruptly elbowed, the joints not
  being numerous, usually about thirteen, and frequently so <span class="pagenum" id="page2"><span
  class="smaller">{2}</span></span>connected that it is not easy to count them. The abdomen is, in
  the great majority, of very peculiar construction, and allows the Insect to curl it completely
  under the anterior parts, so as to roll up into a little ball; the dorsal plates are very strongly
  arched, and seen from beneath form a free edge, while the ventral plates are of less hard
  consistence, and are connected with the dorsal plates at some distance from the free edge, so that
  the abdomen appears concave beneath. In the anomalous genus <i>Cleptes</i> the abdomen is,
  however, similar in form to that of the Aculeate Hymenoptera, and has four or five visible
  segments, instead of the three or four that are all that can be seen in the normal Chrysididae.
  The larvae of the Ruby-flies have the same number of segments as other Hymenoptera Petiolata. The
  difference in this respect of the perfect Chrysididae from other Petiolata is due to a greater
  number of the terminal segments being indrawn so as to form the tube, or telescope-like structure
  from which the series obtains its name. This tube is shown partially extruded in Fig. 1; when
  fully thrust out it is seen to be segmented, and three or four segments may be distinguished. The
  ovipositor proper is concealed within this tube; it appears to be of the nature of an imperfect
  sting; there being a very sharply pointed style, and a pair of enveloping sheaths; the style
  really consists of a trough-like plate and two fine rods or spiculae. There are no poison glands,
  except in <i>Cleptes</i>, which form appears to come very near to the Aculeate series. Some of the
  Chrysididae on occasions use the ovipositor as a sting, though it is only capable of inflicting a
  very minute and almost innocuous wound.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Although none of the Ruby-flies attain a large size, they are usually very conspicuous on
  account of their gaudy or brilliant colours. They are amongst the most restless and rapid of
  Insects; <span class="pagenum" id="page3"><span class="smaller">{3}</span></span>they love the hot
  sunshine, and are difficult of capture. Though not anywhere numerous in species, they are found in
  most parts of the world. In Britain we have about twenty species. They usually frequent old wood
  or masonry, in which the nests of Aculeate Hymenoptera exist, or fly rapidly to and fro about the
  banks of earth where bees nest. Dr. Chapman has observed the habits of some of our British
  species.<a id="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> He noticed <i>Chrysis ignita</i> flying
  about the cell of <i>Odynerus parietum</i>, a solitary wasp that provisions its nest with
  caterpillars; in this cell the <i>Chrysis</i> deposited an egg, and in less than an hour the wasp
  had sealed the cell. Two days afterwards this was opened and was found to contain a larva of
  <i>Chrysis</i> a quarter of an inch long, as well as the Lepidopterous larvae stored up by the
  wasp, but there was no trace of egg or young of the wasp. Six days after the egg was laid the
  <i>Chrysis</i> had eaten all the food and was full-grown, having moulted three or four times.
  Afterwards it formed a cocoon in which to complete its metamorphosis. It is, however, more usual
  for the species of <i>Chrysis</i> to live on the larva of the wasp and not on the food; indeed, it
  has recently been positively stated that <i>Chrysis</i> never eats the food in the wasp's cell,
  but there is no ground whatever for rejecting the evidence of so careful an observer as Dr.
  Chapman. According to M. du Buysson the larva of <i>Chrysis</i> will not eat the lepidopterous
  larvae, but will die in their midst if the <i>Odynerus</i> larva does not develop; but this
  observation probably relates only to such species as habitually live on <i>Odynerus</i> itself.
  The mother-wasp of <i>Chrysis bidentata</i> searches for a cell of <i>Odynerus spinipes</i> that
  has not been properly closed, and that contains a full-grown larva of that wasp enclosed in its
  cocoon. Having succeeded in its search the <i>Chrysis</i> deposits several eggs&mdash;from six to
  ten; for some reason that is not apparent all but one of these eggs fail to produce young; in two
  or three days this one hatches, the others shrivelling up. The young <i>Chrysis</i> larva seizes
  with its mouth a fold of the skin of the helpless larva of the <i>Odynerus</i>, and sucks it
  without inflicting any visible wound. In about eleven days the <i>Chrysis</i> has changed its skin
  four times, has consumed all the larva and is full-fed; it spins its own cocoon inside that of its
  victim, and remains therein till the following spring, when it changes to a pupa, and in less than
  three weeks <span class="pagenum" id="page4"><span class="smaller">{4}</span></span>thereafter
  emerges a perfect <i>Chrysis</i> of the most brilliant colour, and if it be a female indefatigable
  in activity. It is remarkable that the larva of <i>Chrysis</i> is so much like that of
  <i>Odynerus</i> that the two can only be distinguished externally by the colour, the
  <i>Odynerus</i> being yellow and the <i>Chrysis</i> white; but this is only one of the many cases
  in which host and parasite are extremely similar to the eye. <i>Chrysis shanghaiensis</i> has been
  reared from the cocoons of a Lepidopterous Insect&mdash;<i>Monema flavescens</i>, family
  Limacodidae&mdash;and it has been presumed that it eats the larva therein contained. All other
  Chrysids, so far as known, live at the expense of Hymenoptera (usually, as we have seen, actually
  consuming their bodies), and it is not impossible that <i>C. shanghaiensis</i> really lives on a
  Hymenopterous parasite in the cocoon of the Lepidopteron.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Parnopes carnea</i> frequents the nests of <i>Bembex rostrata</i>, a solitary
  wasp that has the unusual habit of bringing from time to time a supply of food to its young larva;
  for this purpose it has to open the nest in which its young is enclosed, and the <i>Parnopes</i>
  takes advantage of this habit by entering the cell and depositing there an egg which produces a
  larva that devours that of the <i>Bembex</i>. The species of the anomalous genus <i>Cleptes</i>
  live, it is believed, at the expense of Tenthredinidae, and in all probability oviposit in their
  cocoons which are placed in the earth.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series 3. Hymenoptera Aculeata.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>The females (whether workers or true females) provided with a sting:
    trochanters usually undivided (monotrochous). Usually the antennae of the males with thirteen,
    of the females with twelve, joints (exceptions in ants numerous).</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>These characters only define this series in a very unsatisfactory manner, as no means of
  distinguishing the "sting" from the homologous structures found in Tubulifera, and in the
  Proctotrypid division of Hymenoptera Parasitica, have been pointed out. As the structure of the
  trochanters is subject to numerous exceptions, the classification at present existing is an
  arbitrary one. It would probably be more satisfactory to separate the Proctotrypidae (or a
  considerable part thereof) from the Parasitica, and unite them with the Tubulifera and Aculeata in
  a great series, characterised by the fact that the ovipositor is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page5"><span class="smaller">{5}</span></span>withdrawn into the body in a direct manner so as
  to be entirely internal, whereas in the Parasitica it is not withdrawn in this manner, but remains
  truly an external organ, though in numerous cases concealed by a process of torsion of the
  terminal segments. If this were done it might be found possible to divide the great group thus
  formed into two divisions characterised by the fact that the ovipositor in one retains its
  function, the egg passing through it (Proctotrypidae and Tubulifera), while in the other the organ
  in question serves as a weapon of offence and defence, and does not act as a true ovipositor, the
  egg escaping at its base. It would, however, be premature to adopt so revolutionary a course until
  the comparative anatomy of the organs concerned shall have received a much greater share of
  attention; a detailed scrutiny of Prototrypidae being particularly desired.</p>

  <p>The Sting of the bee has been described in detail by Kraepelin, Sollmann, Carlet<a id="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and others. It is an extremely perfect mechanical arrangement. The
  sting itself&mdash;independent of the sheaths and adjuncts&mdash;consists of three elongate
  pieces, one of them a gouge-like director, the other two pointed and barbed needles; the director
  is provided with a bead for each of the needles to run on, these latter having a corresponding
  groove; the entrance to the groove is narrower than its subsequent diameter, so that the needles
  play up and down on the director with facility, but cannot be dragged away from it; each needle is
  provided with an arm at the base to which are attached the muscles for its movement. This simple
  manner of describing the mechanical arrangement is, however, incomplete, inasmuch as it includes
  no account of the means by which the poison is conveyed. This is done by a very complex set of
  modifications of all the parts; firstly, the director is enlarged at the anterior part to form a
  chamber, through which the needles play; the needles are each provided with a projecting piece,
  which, as the needle moves, plays in the chamber of the director, and forces downwards any liquid
  that may be therein; the poison-glands open into the chamber, and the projections on the needles,
  acting after the manner of a piston, carry the poison before them. The needles are so arranged on
  <span class="pagenum" id="page7"><span class="smaller">{7}</span></span>the director that they
  enclose between themselves and it a space that forms the channel along which the poison flows, as
  it is carried forwards by the movement of the pistons attached to the needles. If the needles be
  thrust into an object quite as far as, or beyond, the point of the director much poison may be
  introduced into a wound, as the barbs are provided with small orifices placed one above the other,
  while if this be not the case much of the liquid will flow on the outside of the object.</p>

  <p>According to Carlet the poison of the bee is formed by the mixture of the secretions of two
  glands, one of which is acid and the other alkaline; it is very deadly in its effects on other
  Insects. We shall see, however, that the Fossorial Hymenoptera, which catch and sting living prey
  for their young, frequently do not kill but only stupefy it, and Carlet states that in this group
  the alkaline gland is absent or atrophied, so that the poison consists only of the acid; it is
  thus, he thinks, deprived of its lethal power. Moreover, in the Fossoria the needles are destitute
  of barbs, so that the sting does not remain in the wound. Bordas, however, states<a id="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> that in all the numerous Hymenoptera he has examined, both acid
  and alkaline glands exist, but exhibit considerable differences of form in the various groups. He
  gives no explanation of the variety of effects of the poison of different Aculeata.</p>

  <p>The larvae (for figure of larva of <i>Bombus</i>, see Vol. V. p. 488) are, without known
  exception, legless grubs, of soft consistence, living entirely under cover, being protected either
  in cells, or, in the case of social Hymenoptera, in the abodes of the parents. The larvae of Ants
  and fossorial Hymenoptera have the anterior parts of the body long and narrow and abruptly flexed,
  so that their heads hang down in a helpless manner. All the larvae of Aculeates, so far as known,
  are remarkable from the fact that the posterior part of the alimentary canal does not connect with
  the stomach till the larval instar is more or less advanced; hence the food amongst which they
  live cannot be sullied by faecal matter. The pupa is invariably soft, and assumes gradually the
  colour of the perfect Insect. Almost nothing is known as to the intimate details of the
  metamorphosis, and very little as to the changes of external form. According to Packard a period
  intervenes between the stadium of the full-grown larva and that of the pupa, in which a series of
  changes he speaks of as semi-pupal <span class="pagenum" id="page8"><span
  class="smaller">{8}</span></span>are passed through; these, however, have not been followed out in
  the case of any individual, and it is not possible to form any final idea about them, but it seems
  probable that they are largely changes of external shape, in conformity with the great changes
  going on in the internal organs. Owing to the fragmentary nature of observations, much obscurity
  and difference of opinion have existed as to the metamorphosis of Aculeate Hymenoptera. Sir S.
  Saunders gives the following statement as to the larva of a wasp of the genus
  <i>Psiliglossa</i>,<a id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> just before it assumes the pupal
  form: "The respective segments, which are very distinctly indicated, may be defined as
  follows:&mdash;The five anterior, including the head, are compactly welded together, and incapable
  of separate action in the pseudo-pupa state; the third, fourth, and fifth bearing a spiracle on
  either side. The thoracical region terminating here, the two anterior segments are assignable to
  the development of the imago head, as pointed out by Ratzeburg." This inference is not, however,
  correct. We have seen that in the perfect Insect of Petiolate Hymenoptera the first abdominal
  segment is fixed to the thorax, and Saunders' statement is interesting as showing that this
  assignment of parts already exists in the larva, but it in no way proves that the head of the
  imago is formed from the thorax of the larva. It has been stated that the larvae of the Aculeata
  have a different number of segments according to the sex, but this also is incorrect. The
  difference that exists in the perfect Insects in this respect is due to the withdrawal of the
  terminal three segments to the interior in the female, and of two only in the male. The larva
  consists of fourteen segments, and we find this number distributed in the female perfect Insect as
  follows: one constitutes the head, four segments the thorax and propodeum, followed by six
  external segments of the restricted abdomen, and three for the internal structures of the abdomen.
  This agrees with Forel's statement that in the ants the sting is placed in a chamber formed by
  three segments.</p>

  <p>The development of the sting of the common bee has been studied by Dewitz.<a id="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> It takes place in the last larval stage. Although nothing of the
  organ is visible externally in the adult larva, yet if such a larva be placed in spirit, there can
  be seen within the skin certain small appendages on the ventral surface of the penultimate and
  antepenultimate abdominal segments <span class="pagenum" id="page9"><span
  class="smaller">{9}</span></span>(Fig. 4, A) placed two on the one, four on the other; these are
  the rudiments of the sting. In the course of development the terminal three segments are taken
  into the body, and the external pair of the appendages of the twelfth body segment (the ninth
  abdominal) become the sheaths of the sting, and the middle pair become the director; the pair of
  appendages on the eleventh segment give rise to the needles or spiculae. The sting-rudiments at an
  earlier stage (Fig. 4, C) are masses of hypodermis connected with tracheae; there is then but one
  pair on the twelfth segment, and this pair coalesce to form a single mass; the rudiments of the
  pair that form the director are differentiated secondarily from the primary pair of these masses
  of hypodermis. A good deal of discussion has taken place as to whether the component parts of the
  sting&mdash;gonapophyses&mdash;are to be considered as modifications of abdominal extremities
  (<i>i.e.</i> abdominal legs such as exist in Myriapods). Heymons is of opinion that this is not
  the case, but that the leg-rudiments and gonapophysal rudiments are quite distinct.<a id="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The origin of the sting of Hymenoptera (and of the ovipositor of
  parasitic Hymenoptera) is very similar to that of the ovipositor of <i>Locusta</i> (Vol. V. p. 315
  of this work), but there is much difference in the history of the development of the
  rudiments.</p>

  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Although no legs are visible in the adult larva, they really arise

  <p>Four primary divisions of Aculeates are generally recognised, viz. Anthophila (Bees),
  Diploptera (Wasps), Fossores (Solitary Wasps), Heterogyna (Ants). Though apparently they are
  natural, it is impossible to define them by characters that are without some exceptions,
  especially in the case of the males. Ashmead has recently proposed<a id="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> to divide the Fossores; thus making five divisions as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>Body with more or less of the hairs on it plumose .......... 1. Anthophila.</p>
    <p>Hairs of body not plumose.</p>

        .......... 5. Heterogyna.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">We shall here follow the usual method of treating all the fossorial wasps as
  forming a single group, uniting Ashmead's Entomophila and Fossores, as we think their separation
  is only valid for the purposes of a table; the Pompilidae placed by the American savant in
  Fossores being as much allied to Entomophila as they are to the other Fossores with which Ashmead
  associates them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Division I. Anthophila or Apidae&mdash;Bees.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Some of the hairs of the body plumose; parts of the mouth elongated, sometimes
    to a great extent, so as to form a protrusible apparatus, usually tubular with a very flexible
    tip. Basal joint of hind foot elongate. No wingless adult forms; in some cases societies are
    formed, and then barren females called workers exist in great numbers, and carry on the
    industrial operations of the community. Food always derived from the vegetable kingdom, or from
    other Bees.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>There are about 150 genera and 1500 species of bees at present known.  Some call the division
  Mellifera instead of Anthophila. The term Apidae is used by some authorities to denote all the
  bees, while others limit this term to one of the families <span class="pagenum" id="page11"><span
  class="smaller">{11}</span></span>or sub-divisions. The bees are, as a rule, distinguished from
  other Hymenoptera by the hairs, by the great development of the mouth parts to form a proboscis
  (usually, but not correctly, called tongue), and by the modification of the hind-legs; but these
  distinctive characters are in some of the species exhibited in so minor a degree of perfection
  that it is not easy to recognise these primitive forms as Anthophila. A few general remarks on the
  three points mentioned will enable the student to better appreciate the importance of certain
  points we shall subsequently deal with.</p>

  <p>The bees are, as a rule, much more covered with hair than any other of the Hymenoptera.
  Saunders<a id="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> states that he has examined the structure
  of the hairs in all the genera of British Aculeata, and that in none but the Anthophila do
  branched and plumose hairs occur. The function of this kind of hairs is unknown; Saunders
  suggests<a href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> that they may be instrumental in the gathering of
  pollen, but they occur in the parasitic bees as well as in the males, neither of which gather
  pollen. The variety of the positions they occupy on the body seems to offer but little support to
  the suggestion. Not all the hairs of the bee's body are plumose, some are simple, as shown in Fig.
  5, A, and this is specially the case with the hairs that are placed at the edges of the dilated
  plates for carrying pollen. In some forms there is an extensive system of simple hairs all over
  the body, and the "feathers" are distributed between these; and we do not see any reason for
  assuming that the feathered are superior to the simple hairs for gathering and carrying pollen.
  Some bees, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Prosopis</i>, <i>Ceratina</i>, have very little hair on the body, but
  nevertheless some plumose hairs are always present even though they be very short.</p>

  <p>The hind-legs of bees are very largely used in the industrial occupations of these
  indefatigable creatures; one of their chief functions in the female being to act as receptacles
  for carrying pollen to the nest: they exhibit, however, considerable diversity. The parts most
  modified are the tibia and the first joint of the hind-foot. Pollen is carried by other parts of
  the body in many bees, and even the hind-leg itself is used in different ways for the purpose:
  sometimes the outer face of the tibia is highly polished and its margins surrounded by hair, in
  which case pollen plates are said to exist (Fig. 6, A); sometimes the first joint of the tarsus is
  analogous to the tibia both in structure and function; in other cases the hind-legs are thick and
  densely covered with hair that retains the pollen between the separate hairs. In this case the
  pollen is carried home in a dry state, while, in the species with pollen plates, the pollen is
  made into a mass of a clay-like consistence.<a id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The
  legs also assist in arranging the pollen on the other parts of the body. The males do not carry
  pollen, and though their hind-legs are also highly modified, yet the modifications do not agree
  with those of the female, and their functions are in all probability sexual. The parasitic bees
  also do not carry pollen, and exhibit another series of structures. The most interesting case in
  this series of modifications is that found in the genus <i>Apis</i>, where the hind-leg of male,
  female, and worker are all different (Fig. 25); the limb in the worker being highly modified for
  industrial purposes. This case has been frequently referred to, in consequence of the difficulty
  that exists in connection with its heredity, for the <span class="pagenum" id="page13"><span
  class="smaller">{13}</span></span>structure exists in neither of the parents. It is, in fact, a
  case of a very special adaptation appearing in the majority of the individuals of each generation,
  though nothing of the sort occurs in either parent.</p>

  <p>The proboscis of the bee<a id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> is a very complex
  organ, and in its extremely developed forms exhibits a complication of details and a delicacy of
  structure that elicit the admiration of all who study it. In the lower bees, however, especially
  in <i>Prosopis</i>, it exists in a comparatively simple form (Fig. 9, B, C), that differs but
  little from what is seen in some Vespidae or Fossores. The upper lip and the mandibles do not take
  any part in the formation of the bee's proboscis, which is consequently entirely made up from the
  lower lip and the maxillae, the former of these two organs exhibiting the greatest modifications.
  The proboscis is situate on the lower part of the head, and in repose is not visible; a portion,
  and that by no means an inconsiderable one, of its modifications being for the purpose of its
  withdrawal and protection when not in use. For this object the under side of the head is provided
  with a very deep groove, in which the whole organ is, in bees with a short proboscis, withdrawn;
  in the Apidae with a long proboscis this groove also exists, and the basal part of the proboscis
  is buried in it during repose, while the other parts of the elongate organ are doubled on the
  basal part, so that they extend backwards under the body, and the front end or tip of the tongue
  is, when in repose, its most posterior part.</p>

  <p>For the extrusion of the proboscis there exists a special apparatus that comes into play after
  the mandibles are unlocked and the labrum lifted. This extensive apparatus cannot be
  satisfactorily illustrated by a drawing, as the parts composing it are placed in different planes;
  but it may be described by saying that the cardo, or basal hinge of the maxilla, changes from an
  oblique to a vertical position, and thrusts the base of the proboscis out of the groove. The
  maxillae form the outer sheath of the proboscis, the lower lip its medial part (see Figs. 7 and
  9); the base of the lower lip is attached to the submentum, which rises with the cardo so that
  labium and maxillae are lifted together; the co-operation of these two parts is effected by an
  angular piece called the lorum, in which the base of the submentum rests; the submentum is
  articulated with the mentum in such a manner that the two can either be placed in planes at a
  right angle to one another, or can be brought into one continuous plane, and by this change of
  plane the basal part of the tongue can also be thrust forwards.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is considerable variety in the lengths of these parts in different genera, and the lorum
  varies in shape in accordance with the length of the submentum. The lorum is a peculiar piece, and
  its mechanical adaptations are very remarkable; usually the base of the submentum rests in the
  angle formed by the junction of the two sides of the lorum, but in <i>Xylocopa</i>, where the
  submentum is unusually short, this part reposes in a groove on the back of the lorum, this latter
  having a very broad truncated apex instead of an angular one; in the condition of repose the apex
  of the lorum rests in a notch on the middle of the back of the oral groove, and in some of the
  forms with elongate submentum, this depression is transformed into a deep hole, or even a sort of
  tunnel, so as to permit the complete stowing away of the base of the tongue, which would otherwise
  be prevented by the long submentum; another function of the lorum appears to be that, as it
  extends, its arms have an outward thrust, and so separate the maxillae from the labium. In
  addition to these parts there are also four elongate, slender sclerites that are only brought into
  view on dissection, and that no doubt assist in correlating the movements of the parts of the
  mouth and <span class="pagenum" id="page15"><span class="smaller">{15}</span></span>hypopharynx;
  one pair of these strap-like pieces extends backwards from the two sides of the base of the
  epipharynx; Huxley called them sclerites of the oesophagus; a better name would be epipharyngeal
  sclerites (Fig. 7, <i>a</i>): the other pair pass from the terminations of the epipharyngeal
  sclerites, along the front face of the hypopharynx, down to the mentum, their lower parts being
  concealed by the stipites of the maxillae; these are the hypopharyngeal sclerites, and we believe
  it will prove that they play a highly important part in deglutition. When the labrum of a bee is
  raised and the proboscis depressed, the epipharynx is seen hanging like a curtain from the roof of
  the head; this structure plays an important part in the act of deglutition. The entrance to the
  pharynx, or commencement of the alimentary canal, is placed below the base of the epipharynx. As
  we are not aware of any good delineations of the basal parts of the proboscis we give a figure
  thereof (Fig. 7). The maxillae in the higher bees are extremely modified so as to form a sheath,
  and their palpi are minute; in the lower bees the palpi have the structure usual in mandibulate
  Insects.</p>

  <p>Returning to the consideration of the lower lip, we find that there is attached to the mentum a
  pair of elongate organs that extend forwards and form a tube or sheath, enclosed by the maxillary
  sheath we have previously mentioned; these are the greatly modified labial palpi, their distal
  parts still retaining the palpar form; and in the lower bees the labial palpi are, like the
  maxillary, of the form usual in mandibulate Insects. Between the labial palps and the central
  organ of the lip there is attached a pair of delicate organs, the paraglossae.</p>

  <p>There remains for consideration the most remarkable part of the proboscis, the long, delicate,
  hairy organ which the bee thrusts out from the tip of the shining tube formed by the labial palps
  and the maxillae, described above, and which looks like a prolongation of the mentum. This organ
  is variously called ligula, lingua, or tongue.<a id="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> We
  prefer the first of these names.</p>

  <p>According to Breithaupt and Cheshire the structure of the ligula is highly remarkable; it is a
  tube (filled with fluid from the body cavity), and with a groove underneath caused by a large part
  of the circumference of the tube being invaginated; the <span class="pagenum" id="page16"><span
  class="smaller">{16}</span></span>invaginated part can be thrust out by increase of the pressure
  of the fluid in the tube. A portion of the wall of the invaginate part is thickened so as to form
  a chitinous rod.</p>

  <p>This description will suffice for present purposes, as the other parts of the mouth will be
  readily recognised by the aid of figure 9, A, B, C. In the exquisitely endowed South American
  genus <i>Euglossa</i> (Fig. 18), the proboscis is somewhat longer than the whole of the body, so
  that its tip in repose projects behind the body like a sting.</p>

  <p>The correct nomenclature of the parts connected with the lower lip is not definitely settled,
  authorities not being agreed on several points. The whole of the proboscis is usually called the
  tongue; this, however, is admittedly an erroneous application of this term. The terminal delicate,
  elongate, flexible organ is by some called the tongue; but this again is wrong: the lingua in
  Insects is the hypopharynx; this part is developed in a peculiar manner in bees, but as it is not
  tongue-like in shape, the term lingua is not suitable for it, and should be dismissed altogether
  from the nomenclature of the bee's trophi; it is used at present in two different senses, both of
  which are erroneous. We see no objection to describing the flexible apical portion of the
  proboscis as the ligula. The lorum is probably a special part peculiar to the higher bees;
  according to Saunders it is not present as a specialised part in some of the primitive forms.<a

  <p>The way in which the proboscis of the bee acts has been very largely discussed, with special
  reference to the question as to whether it is a sucking or a licking action. It is impossible to
  consider either of these terms as applicable. The foundation of the action is capillary
  attraction, by which, and by slight movements of increase and contraction of the capacity of
  various parts, the fluid travels to the cavity in front of the hypopharynx: here the scales of the
  maxillae leave a vacant space, (Fig. 7, <i>e</i>) so that a cup or cavity is formed, the fluid in
  which is within reach of the tip of the dependent epipharynx (<i>c</i>), which hangs down over the
  front of the hypopharynx (and is so shaped that its tip covers the cup); it is between these two
  parts that the fluid passes to reach the pharynx. It is no doubt to slight movements of the
  membranous parts of the hypopharynx and of the epipharynx that the further progress of the nectar
  is due, aided by contraction and expansion of the pharynx, induced by muscles attached to it. It
  should be recollected that in addition to the movements of the head itself, the hypopharynx is
  constantly changing its dimensions slightly by the impulses of the fluid of the general body
  cavity; also that the head changes its position, <span class="pagenum" id="page18"><span
  class="smaller">{18}</span></span>and that the proboscis is directed downwards as well as
  forwards. Those who wish to pursue this subject should refer to the works of Breithaupt<a
  id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and Cheshire.</p>

  <p>The other external characters of the Bees call for little remark. The pronotum is never very
  large or much prolonged in front, and its hind angles never repose on the tegulae as they do in
  the wasps,<a id="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> but extend backwards below the tegulae.
  The hind body is never narrowed at the base into an elongate pedicel, as it so frequently is in
  the Wasps and in the Fossors; and the propodeum (the posterior part of the thorax) is more
  perpendicular and rarely so largely developed as it is in the Fossors; this last character will as
  a rule permit a bee to be recognised at a glance from the fossorial Hymenoptera.</p>

  <p>Bees, as every one knows, frequent flowers, and it is usually incorrectly said that they
  extract honey. They really gather nectar, swallow it, so that it goes as far as the crop of their
  alimentary canal, called in English the honey-sac, and is regurgitated as honey. Bertrand states
  that the nectar when gathered is almost entirely pure saccharose, and that when regurgitated it is
  found to consist of dextrose and levulose:<a id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> this
  change appears to be practically the conversion of cane- into grape-sugar. A small quantity of the
  products of the salivary glands is added, and this probably causes the change alluded to; so that
  honey and nectar are by no means synonymous. According to Cheshire the glandular matter is added
  while the nectar is being sucked, and is passing over the middle parts of the lower lip, so that
  the nectar may be honey when swallowed by the bee. In addition to gathering nectar the female bees
  are largely occupied in collecting pollen, which, mixed with honey, is to serve as food for the
  colony. Many, if not all, bees eat pollen while collecting it. The mode in which they accumulate
  the pollen, and the mechanism of its conveyance from hair to hair till it reaches the part of the
  body it must attain in order to be removed for packing in the cells, is not fully understood, but
  it appears to be accomplished by complex correlative actions of various parts; the head and the
  front legs scratch up the pollen, the legs move with great rapidity, and the pollen ultimately
  reaches its destination. The workers of the genus <i>Apis</i>, and of some other social <span
  class="pagenum" id="page19"><span class="smaller">{19}</span></span>bees, have the basal joint of
  the hind foot specially adapted to deal with pollen (Fig. 25, 2). We have already mentioned the
  modifications of the legs used for its conveyance, and need here only add that numerous
  bees&mdash;the Dasygastres&mdash;carry the pollen by aid of a special and dense clothing of hairs
  on the underside of the abdomen.</p>

  <p>The buzzing of bees (and other Insects) has been for long a subject of controversy: some having
  maintained that it is partially or wholly due to the vibration of parts connected with the
  spiracles, while others have found its cause in the vibrations of the wings. According to the
  observations of P&eacute;rez and Bellesme,<a id="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> two distinct
  sounds are to be distinguished. One, a deep noise, is due to the vibration of the wings, and is
  produced whenever a certain rapidity is attained; the other is an acute sound, and is said to be
  produced by the vibrations of the walls of the thorax, to which muscles are attached; this sound
  is specially evident in Diptera and Hymenoptera, because the integument is of the right
  consistence for vibration. Both of these observers agree that the spiracles are not concerned in
  the matter.</p>

  <p>The young of bees are invariably reared in cells. These (except in the case of the parasitical
  bees) are constructed by the mothers, or by the transformed females called workers. The solitary
  bees store the cells with food, and close up each cell after having laid an egg in it, so that in
  these cases each larva consumes a special store previously provided for it. The social bees do not
  close the cells in which the larvae are placed, and the workers act as foster-mothers, feeding the
  young larvae after the same fashion as birds feed their nestling young. The food is a mixture of
  honey and pollen, the mixing being effected in various ways and proportions according to the
  species; the honey seems to be particularly suitable to the digestive organs of the young larvae,
  and those bees that make closed cells, place on the outside of the mass of food a layer more
  thickly saturated with honey, and this layer the young grub consumes before attacking the drier
  parts of the provisions. The active life of the larva is quite short, but after the larva is
  full-grown it usually passes a more or less prolonged period in a state of quiescence before
  assuming the pupal form. The pupa shows the limbs and other parts of the perfect Insect in a very
  distinct manner, and the <span class="pagenum" id="page20"><span
  class="smaller">{20}</span></span>development of the imago takes place gradually though quickly.
  Some larvae spin cocoons, others do not.</p>

  <p>A very large number of bees are parasitic in their habits, laying an egg, or sometimes more
  than one, in the cell of a working bee of some species other than their own; in such cases the
  resulting larvae eat and grow more quickly than the progeny of the host bee, and so cause it to
  die of starvation. It has been observed that some of these parasitic larvae, after eating all the
  store of food, then devour the larva they have robbed. In other cases it is possible that the
  first care of the parasitic larva, after hatching, is to eat the rival egg.</p>

  <p>The taxonomy of bees is in a very unsatisfactory state. The earlier Hymenopterists were divided
  into two schools, one of which proposed to classify the bees according to their habits, while the
  other adopted an arrangement depending on the length of the parts of the mouth, the development of
  the palpi, and the form and positions of the organs for carrying pollen. Neither of these
  arrangements was at all satisfactory, and some entomologists endeavoured to combine them, the
  result being a classification founded partly on habits and partly on certain minor structural
  characters. This course has also proved unsatisfactory; this is especially the case with exotic
  bees, which have been placed in groups that are defined by habits, although very little
  observation has actually been made on this point. Efforts have recently been made to establish an
  improved classification, but as they relate solely to the European bees they are insufficient for
  general purposes.</p>

  <p>The more important of the groups that have been recognised are&mdash;(1) the Obtusilingues,
  short-tongued bees, with the tip of the lingua bifid or broad; (2) Acutilingues, short-tongued
  bees, with acute tip to the tongue; these two groups being frequently treated of as forming the
  Andrenidae. Coming to the Apidae, or the bees with long and folded tongues, there have been
  distinguished (3) Scopulipedes, bees carrying pollen with their feet, and (4) Dasygastres, those
  that carry it under the abdomen; some of the parasitic and other forms have been separated as (5)
  Denudatae (or Cuculinae); the Bombi and the more perfectly social bees forming another group, viz.
  (6) Sociales. A group Andrenoides, or Panurgides, was also proposed for certain bees considered to
  belong to the Apidae though exhibiting many points of <span class="pagenum" id="page21"><span
  class="smaller">{21}</span></span>resemblance with the Andrenidae. This arrangement is by no means
  satisfactory, but as the tropical bees have been but little collected, and are only very
  imperfectly known, it is clear that we cannot hope for a better classification till collections
  have been very much increased and improved. The arrangement adopted in Dalla Torre's recent
  valuable catalogue of bees<a id="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> recognises no less than
  fourteen primary divisions, but is far from satisfactory.</p>

  <p>The two genera <i>Prosopis</i> and <i>Sphecodes</i> have been recently formed into a special
  family, Archiapidae, by Friese,<a id="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> who, however,
  admits that the association is not a natural one. The term should be limited to <i>Prosopis</i>
  and the genera into which it has been, or shortly will be, divided. The primitive nature of the
  members of this genus is exhibited in all the external characters that are most distinctive of
  bees; the proboscis (Fig. 9, B, C), is quite short, its ligula being very short, and instead of
  being pointed having a concave front margin. The body is almost bare, though there is some very
  short feathered plumage. The hind legs are destitute of modifications for industrial purposes.
  Owing to these peculiarities it was for long assumed that the species of <i>Prosopis</i> must be
  parasites. This is, however, known not to be the case so far as many of the species are concerned.
  They form cells lined with a silken membrane in the stems of brambles and other plants that are
  suitable, or in burrows in the earth, or in the mortar of walls; individuals of the same species
  varying much as to the nidus they select. The food they store in these cells is much more liquid
  than usual, and has been supposed to be entirely honey, since they have no apparatus for carrying
  pollen. Mr. R. C. L. Perkins has, however, observed that they swallow both pollen and nectar,
  brushing the first-named substance to the mouth by aid of the front legs. He <span class="pagenum"
  id="page22"><span class="smaller">{22}</span></span>has ascertained that a few of the very
  numerous Hawaiian species of the genus are really parasitic on their congeners: these parasites
  are destitute of a peculiar arrangement of hairs on the front legs of the female, the possession
  of which, by some of the non-parasitic forms, enables the bee to sweep the pollen towards its
  mouth. These observations show that the structural peculiarities of <i>Prosopis</i> are
  correlative with the habits of forming a peculiar lining to the cell, and of gathering pollen by
  the mouth and conveying it by the alimentary canal instead of by external parts of the body.
  <i>Prosopis</i> is a very widely distributed genus, and very numerous in species. We have ten in
  Britain; several of them occur in the grounds of our Museum at Cambridge.</p>

  <p>The species of the genus <i>Colletes</i> are hairy bees of moderate size, with a good
  development of hair on the middle and posterior femora for carrying pollen. They have a short,
  bilobed ligula like that of wasps, and therein differ from the Andrenae, which they much resemble.
  With <i>Prosopis</i> they form the group Obtusilingues of some taxonomists. They have a manner of
  nesting peculiar to themselves; they dig cylindrical burrows in the earth, line them with a sort
  of slime, that dries to a substance like gold-beater's skin, and then by partitions arrange the
  burrow as six to ten separate cells, each of which is filled with food that is more liquid than
  usual in bees. Except in regard to the ligula and the nature of the cell-lining, <i>Colletes</i>
  has but little resemblance to <i>Prosopis</i>; but the term Obtusilingues may be applied to
  <i>Colletes</i> if <i>Prosopis</i> be separated as Archiapidae. We have six species of
  <i>Colletes</i> in Britain.</p>

  <p><i>Sphecodes</i> is a genus that has been the subject of prolonged difference of opinion. The
  species are rather small shining bees, with a red, or red and black, abdomen, almost without
  pollen-collecting apparatus, and with a short but pointed ligula. These characters led to the
  belief that the Insects are parasitic, or, as they are sometimes called, cuckoo-bees. But evidence
  could not be obtained of the fact, and as they were seen to make burrows it was decided that we
  have in <i>Sphecodes</i> examples of industrial bees extremely ill endowed for their work. Recent
  observations tend, however, to prove that <i>Sphecodes</i> are to a large extent parasitic at the
  expense of bees of the genera <i>Halictus</i> and <i>Andrena</i>. Breitenbach has taken <i>S.
  rubicundus</i> out of the brood-cells of <i>Halictus quadricinctus</i>; and on one of the few
  <span class="pagenum" id="page23"><span class="smaller">{23}</span></span>occasions on which this
  bee has been found in Britain it was in circumstances that left little doubt as to its being a
  parasite of <i>Andrena nigroaenea</i>. Marchal<a id="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> has
  seen <i>S. subquadratus</i> fight with <i>Halictus malachurus</i>, and kill it previous to taking
  possession of its burrows; and similar observations have been made by Ferton. As the older
  observations of Smith, Sichel, and Friese leave little doubt that <i>Sphecodes</i> are sometimes
  industrial bees, it is highly probable that we have in this genus the interesting condition of
  bees that are sometimes parasitic, at other times not; but so much obscurity still prevails as to
  the habits of <i>Sphecodes</i> that we should do well to delay accepting the theories that have
  been already based on this strange state of matters.<a id="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Friese states that in <i>Sphecodes</i> the first traces of
  collecting apparatus exist; and, accepting the condition of affairs as being that mentioned above,
  it is by no means clear whether we have in <i>Sphecodes</i> bees that are abandoning the parasitic
  habit or commencing it; or, indeed, whether the condition of uncertainty may not be a permanent
  one. It is difficult to decide as to what forms are species in <i>Sphecodes</i> owing to the great
  variation. The Hymenopterist Forster considered that 600 specimens submitted to him by Sichel
  represented no less than 140 species, though Sichel was convinced that nearly the whole of them
  were one species, <i>S. gibbus</i>. It has recently been found that the male sexual organs afford
  a satisfactory criterion. The position of <i>Sphecodes</i> in classification is doubtful.</p>

  <p>The great majority of the species of short-tongued bees found in Britain belong to the genera
  <i>Andrena</i> and <i>Halictus</i>, and with some others constitute the Andrenides of many
  writers. <i>Halictus</i> includes our smallest British bees. Their economy escaped the earlier
  observers, but has recently been to some extent unravelled by Smith, Fabre, Nicolas, Verhoeff, and
  others, and proves to be <span class="pagenum" id="page24"><span
  class="smaller">{24}</span></span>of great interest and variety. Fabre observed <i>H.
  lineolatus</i> and <i>H. sexcinctus</i><a id="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> under
  circumstances that enabled him to give them continuous attention, whenever requisite, throughout a
  whole year. These bees are to a certain extent social; they are gregarious; each bee works for its
  own progeny, but there is collaboration between members of a colony, inasmuch as a piece of
  general work is undertaken from which more families than one derive benefit. This common work is a
  gallery, that, ramifying in the earth, gives access to various groups of cells, each group the
  production of a single <i>Halictus</i>; in this way one entrance and one corridor serve for
  several distinct dwellings. The work of excavation is carried on at night. The cells are oval, and
  are covered on the interior with a delicate waterproof varnish; Fabre considers this to be a
  product of the salivary glands, like the membrane we noticed when speaking of <i>Colletes</i>. In
  the south of France both sexes of these species are produced from the nests in September, and then
  the males are much more numerous than the females; when the cold weather sets in the males die,
  but the females continue to live on in the cells underground. In the following spring the females
  come out and recommence working at the burrows, and also provision the cells for the young; the
  new generation, consisting entirely of females, appears in July, and from these there proceeds a
  parthenogenetic generation, which assumes the perfect form in September, and consists, as we have
  above remarked, in greater part of males. P&eacute;rez,<a id="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
  however, considers that Fabre's observations as to the parthenogenetic generation were incomplete,
  and that males might have been found a little earlier, and he consequently rejects altogether the
  occurrence of parthenogenesis in <i>Halictus</i>. Nicolas confirms Fabre's observations, so far as
  the interesting point of the work done for common benefit is concerned; and adds that the common
  corridor being too narrow to permit of two bees passing, there is a dilatation or vestibule near
  the entrance that facilitates passage, and also that a sentinel is stationed at this point.</p>

  <p>Smith's observations on <i>Halictus morio</i> in England lead one to infer that there is but
  one generation, the appearance of which extends over a very long period. He says, "Early in April
  the females appeared, and continued in numbers up to the end of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page25"><span class="smaller">{25}</span></span>June"; then there was an interval, and in the
  middle of August males began to appear, followed in ten or twelve days by females. Hence it is
  probable that in different countries the times of appearance and the number of generations of the
  same species may vary. Verhoeff has described the burrows of <i>Halictus quadricinctus</i> with
  some detail. The cells, instead of being distributed as usual throughout the length of the burrow
  one by one, are accumulated into a mass placed in a vault communicating with the shaft. This shaft
  is continued downwards to a depth of 10 cm., and forms a retreat for the bees when engaged in
  construction. Several advantages are secured by this method, especially better ventilation, and
  protection from any water that may enter the shaft. The larvae that are present in the
  brood-chambers at any one moment differ much in their ages, a fact that throws some doubt on the
  supposed parthenogenetic generation. No cocoons are formed by these <i>Halictus</i>, the polished
  interior of the cell being a sufficiently refined resting place for metamorphosis. Verhoeff states
  that many of the larvae are destroyed by mouldiness; this indeed, he considers to be the most
  deadly of the enemies of Aculeate Hymenoptera. The nest of <i>Halictus maculatus</i> has also been
  briefly described by Verhoeff, and is a very poor construction in comparison with that of <i>H.
  quadricinctus</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Andrena</i> includes a great number of species, Britain possessing about fifty.
  They may be described in a general manner as Insects much resembling the honey-bee&mdash;for
  which, indeed, they are frequently mistaken&mdash;but usually a little smaller in size. Many of
  the bees we see in spring, in March or April, are of this genus. They live in burrows in the
  ground, preferring sandy places, but frequently selecting a gravel path as the locality for their
  operations; they nearly always live <span class="pagenum" id="page26"><span
  class="smaller">{26}</span></span>in colonies. Great difficulties attend their study on account of
  several points in their economy, such as, that the sexes are different, and frequently not found
  together; also that there may be two generations of a species in one year, these being more or
  less different from one another. Another considerable difficulty arises from the fact that these
  bees are subject to the attacks of the parasite <i>Stylops</i>, by which their form is more or
  less altered. These Insects feed in the body of the bee in such a way as to affect its nutrition
  without destroying its life; hence they offer a means of making experiments that may throw
  valuable light on obscure physiological questions. Among the effects they produce in the condition
  of the imago bee we may mention the enfeeblement of the sexual distinction, so that a stylopised
  male bee becomes less different than it usually is from the female, and a stylopised female may be
  ill developed and less different than usual from the male. The colours and hair are sometimes
  altered, and distortion of portions of the abdominal region of the bee are very common. Further
  particulars as to these parasites will be found at the end of our account of Coleoptera (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page298">298</a></span>). We may here remark that these <i>Stylops</i>
  are not the only parasitic Insects that live in the bodies of Andrenidae without killing their
  hosts, or even interrupting their metamorphoses. Mr. R. C. L. Perkins recently captured a specimen
  of <i>Halictus rubicundus</i>, from which he, judging from the appearance of the example,
  anticipated that a <i>Stylops</i> would emerge; but instead of this a Dipterous Insect of the
  family Chloropidae appeared. Dufour in 1837 called attention to a remarkable relation existing
  between <i>Andrena aterrima</i> and a parasitic Dipterous larva. The larva takes up a position in
  the interior of the bee's body so as to be partly included in one of the great tracheal vesicles
  at the base of the abdomen; and the bee then maintains the parasite in its position, and at the
  same time supplies it with air by causing two tracheae to grow into its body. Dufour states that
  he demonstrated the continuity of the tracheae of the two organisms, but it is by no means clear
  that the continuity was initially due to the bee's organisation.</p>

  three submarginal cells (just beneath the stigma) on the front wing. The female of <i>D.
  hirtipes</i> has a very dense and elongate pubescence on the posterior legs, and carries loads of
  pollen, each about half its own weight, to its nest. The habits of this insect have been described
  by Hermann M&uuml;ller.<a id="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> It forms burrows in the ground
  after the fashion of <i>Andrena</i>; this task is accomplished by excavating with the mandibles;
  when it has detached a certain quantity of the earth it brings this to the surface by moving
  backwards, and then distributes the loose soil over a considerable area. It accomplishes this in a
  most beautiful manner by means of the combined action of all the legs, each pair of these limbs
  performing its share of the function in a different manner; the front legs acting with great
  rapidity&mdash;making four movements in a second&mdash;push the sand backwards under the body, the
  bee moving itself at the same time in this direction by means of the middle pair of legs;
  simultaneously, but with a much slower movement, the hind legs are stretched and moved outwards,
  in oar-like fashion, from the body, and thus sweep away the earth and distribute it towards each
  side. This being done the bee returns quickly into the hole, excavates some more earth, brings it
  up and distributes it. Each operation of excavation takes a minute or two, the distribution on the
  surface only about fifteen seconds. The burrow extends to the length of one or two feet, so that a
  considerable amount of earth has to be brought up; and when the Insect has covered one part of the
  circumference of the mouth of the hole with loose earth, it makes another patch, or walk, by the
  side of the first. The main burrow being completed, the Insect then commences the formation of
  brood-chambers in connection with it. Three to six such chambers are formed in connection with a
  burrow; the lower one is first made and is provisioned by the bee: for this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page28"><span class="smaller">{28}</span></span>purpose five or six loads of pollen are
  brought to the cell, each load being, as we have already remarked, about half the weight of the
  Insect. This material is then formed into a ball and made damp with honey; then another load of
  pollen is brought, is mixed with honey and added as an outer layer to the ball, which is now
  remodelled and provided on one side with three short feet, after which an egg is placed on the top
  of the mass; the bee then sets to work to make a second chamber, and uses the material resulting
  from the excavation of this to close completely the first chamber. The other chambers are
  subsequently formed in a similar manner, and then the burrow itself is filled up. While engaged in
  ascertaining these facts, M&uuml;ller also made some observations on the way the bee acts when
  disturbed in its operations, and his observations on this point show a very similar instinct to
  that displayed by <i>Chalicodoma</i>, referred to on a subsequent page. If interrupted while
  storing a chamber the Insect will not attempt to make a fresh one, but will carry its stock of
  provisions to the nest of some other individual. The result of this proceeding is a struggle
  between the two bees, from which it is satisfactory to learn that the rightful proprietor always
  comes out victorious. The egg placed on the pollen-ball in the chamber hatches in a few days,
  giving birth to a delicate white larva of curved form. This creature embraces the pollen-ball so
  far as its small size will enable it to do so, and eats the food layer by layer so as to preserve
  its circular form. The larva when hatched has no anal orifice and voids no excrement, so that its
  food is not polluted; a proper moulting apparently does not take place, for though a new delicate
  skin may be found beneath the old one this latter is not definitely cast off. When the food, which
  was at first 100 to 140 times larger than the egg or young larva, is all consumed the creature
  then for the first time voids its refuse. During its growth the larva becomes red and increases in
  weight from .0025 grains to .26 or .35 grains, but during the subsequent period of excretion it
  diminishes to .09 or .15 grains, and in the course of doing so becomes a grub without power of
  movement, and of a white instead of a red colour. After this the larva reposes motionless for many
  months&mdash;in fact, until the next summer, when it throws off the larval skin and appears as a
  pupa. The larval skin thus cast off contrasts greatly with the previous delicate <span
  class="pagenum" id="page29"><span class="smaller">{29}</span></span>condition of the integument,
  for this last exuvium is thick and rigid. Although it voids no excrement till much later the union
  of the stomach and hind-intestine is accomplished when the larva is half-grown. A larva, from
  which M&uuml;ller took away a portion of its unconsumed food-store, began directly afterwards to emit
  excrement. The pupa has greater power of movement than the resting larva; when it has completed
  its metamorphosis and become a perfect Insect, it, if it be a female, commences almost immediately
  after its emergence to form burrows by the complex and perfect series of actions we have
  described.</p>

  <p><b>Parasitic Bees</b> (Denudatae).&mdash;This group of parasitic bees includes fourteen
  European genera, of which six are British. They form a group taxonomically most unsatisfactory,
  the members having little in common except the negative characters of the absence of
  pollen-carrying apparatus. Although there is a great dearth of information as to the
  life-histories of parasitic bees, yet some highly interesting facts and generalisations about
  their relations with their hosts have already been obtained. Verhoeff has recently given the
  following account of the relations between the parasitic bee <i>Stelis minuta</i> and its host
  <i>Osmia leucomelana</i>:&mdash;The <i>Osmia</i> forms cells in blackberry stems, provisions them
  in the usual manner, and deposits an egg in each. But the <i>Stelis</i> lays an egg in the store
  of provisions before the <i>Osmia</i> does, and thus its egg is placed lower down in the mass of
  food than that of the legitimate owner, which is in fact at the top. The <i>Stelis</i> larva
  emerges from the egg somewhat earlier than the <i>Osmia</i> larva does. For a considerable time
  the two larvae so disclosed consume together the stock of provisions, the <i>Osmia</i> at the
  upper, the <i>Stelis</i> at the lower, end thereof. By the consumption of the provisions the two
  larvae are brought into proximity, and by this time the <i>Stelis</i> larva, being about twice the
  size of the <i>Osmia</i> larva, kills and eats it. Verhoeff witnessed the struggle between the two
  larvae, and states further that the operation of eating the <i>Osmia</i> larva after it has been
  killed lasts one or two days. He adds that parasitic larvae are less numerous than the host
  larvae, it being well known that parasitic bees produce fewer offspring than host bees. Verhoeff
  further states that he has observed similar relations to obtain between the larvae of other
  parasitic bees and their hosts, but warns us against concluding that the facts are analogous in
  all cases.</p>

  <p>Fabre has made us acquainted with some points in the history of another species of the same
  genus, viz. <i>Stelis nasuta</i>, that show a decided departure from the habits of <i>S.
  minuta</i>. The first-named Insect accomplishes the very difficult task of breaking open the cells
  of the mason-bee, <i>Chalicodoma muraria</i>, after they have been sealed up, and then, being an
  Insect of much smaller size than the <i>Chalicodoma</i>, places several eggs in one cell of that
  bee. Friese informs us that parasitic bees and their hosts, in a great number of cases, not only
  have in the perfect state the tongue similarly formed, but also frequent the same species of
  flower; thus <i>Colletes daviesanus</i> and its parasite <i>Epeolus variegatus</i> both specially
  affect the flowers of <i>Tanacetum vulgare</i>. Some of the parasitic bees have a great
  resemblance to their hosts; <i>Stelis signata</i>, for instance, is said to be so like
  <i>Anthidium strigatum</i> that for many years it was considered to be a species of the genus
  <i>Anthidium</i>. In other cases not the least resemblance exists between the parasites and hosts.
  Thus the species of <i>Nomada</i> that live at the expense of species of the genus <i>Andrena</i>
  have no resemblance thereto. Friese further tells us that the <i>Andrena</i> and <i>Nomada</i> are
  on the most friendly terms. <i>Andrena</i>, as is well known, forms populous colonies in banks,
  paths, etc., and in these colonies the destroying <i>Nomada</i> flies about unmolested; indeed,
  according to Friese, it is treated as a welcome guest. He says he has often seen, and in several
  localities, <i>Nomada lathburiana</i> and <i>Andrena ovina</i> flying peacefully together. The
  <i>Nomada</i> would enter a burrow, and if it found the <i>Andrena</i> therein, would come out and
  try another burrow; if when a marauding <i>Nomada</i> was in a burrow, and the rightful owner,
  returning laden with pollen, found on entering its home that an uninvited guest was therein, the
  <i>Andrena</i> would go out in order to permit the exit of the <i>Nomada</i>, and then would again
  enter and add the pollen to the store. Strange as this may seem at first sight, it is really not
  so, for, as we have before had occasion to observe, there is not the slightest reason for
  believing that host Insects have any idea whatever that the parasites or inquilines are injurious
  to their <span class="pagenum" id="page31"><span class="smaller">{31}</span></span>race. Why then
  should they attack the creatures? Provided the parasites do not interfere in any unmannerly way
  with the hosts and their work, there is no reason why the latter should resent their presence. The
  wild bee that seals up its cell when it has laid an egg therein, and then leaves it for ever, has
  no conception of the form of its progeny; never in the history of the race of the <i>Andrena</i>
  has a larva seen a perfect insect and survived thereafter, never has a perfect Insect seen a
  larva. There is no reason whatever for believing that these Insects have the least conception of
  their own metamorphosis, and how then should they have any idea of the metamorphosis of the
  parasite? If the <i>Andrena</i> found in the pollen the egg of a parasitic <i>Nomada</i>, it could
  of course easily remove the egg; but the <i>Andrena</i> has no conception that the presence of the
  egg ensures the death of its own offspring and though the egg be that of an enemy to its race, why
  should it resent the fact? Is it not clear that the race has always maintained itself
  notwithstanding the enemy? Nature has brought about that both host and parasite should
  successfully co-exist; and each individual of each species lives, not for itself, but for the
  continuance of the species; that continuance is provided for by the relative fecundities of host
  and guest. Why then should the <i>Andrena</i> feel alarm? If the species of <i>Nomada</i> attack
  the species of <i>Andrena</i> too much it brings about the destruction of its own species more
  certainly than that of the <i>Andrena</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Such extremely friendly relations do not, however, exist between all the parasitic bees and
  their hosts. Friese says that, so far as he has been able to observe, the relations between the
  two are not in general friendly. He states that marauders of the genera <i>Melecta</i> and
  <i>Coelioxys</i> seek to get out of the way when they see the pollen-laden host coming home. But
  he does not appear to have noted any other evidence of mistrust between the two, and it is
  somewhat doubtful whether this act can properly be interpreted as indicating fear, for bees, as
  well as other animals, when engaged in work find it annoying to be interfered <span
  class="pagenum" id="page32"><span class="smaller">{32}</span></span>with; it is the interest of
  the parasite to avoid annoyance and to be well-mannered in its approaches. Shuckard, however, says
  that battles ensue between the parasite <i>Melecta</i> and its host <i>Anthophora</i>, when the
  two bees meet in the burrows of the <i>Anthophora</i>.<a id="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We shall have occasion to remark on some of the habits of <i>Dioxys cincta</i> when considering
  the history of the mason-bee (<i>Chalicodoma</i>), but one very curious point in its economy must
  here be noticed. The <i>Dioxys</i>, which is a much smaller bee than the <i>Chalicodoma</i>, lays
  an egg in a cell of the latter, and the resulting larva frequently has more food in the cell than
  it can consume; there is, however, another bee, <i>Osmia cyanoxantha</i>, that frequently takes
  advantage of an unoccupied cell in the nest of the <i>Chalicodoma</i>, and establishes its own
  offspring therein. The <i>Dioxys</i>, it seems, cannot, or at any rate does not, distinguish
  whether a cell is occupied by <i>Chalicodoma</i> or by <i>Osmia</i>, and sometimes lays its egg in
  the nest of the <i>Osmia</i>, though this bee is small, and therefore provides very little food
  for its young. It might be supposed that under these conditions the <i>Dioxys</i> larva would be
  starved to death; but this is not so; it has the power of accommodating its appetite, or its
  capacity for metamorphosis, to the quantity of food it finds at its disposal, and the egg laid in
  the <i>Osmia</i> cell actually produces a tiny specimen of <i>Dioxys</i>, only about half the
  natural size. Both sexes of these dwarf <i>Dioxys</i> are produced, offering another example of
  the fact that the quantity of food ingested during the lifetime of the larva does not influence
  the sex of the resulting imago.</p>

  <p>The highly endowed bees that remain to be considered are by some writers united in a group
  called Apidae, in distinction from Andrenidae. For the purposes of this work we shall adopt three
  divisions, Scopulipedes, Dasygastres, Sociales.</p>

  <p>The group Scopulipedes includes such long-tongued, solitary bees as are not parasitic, and do
  not belong to the Dasygastres. It is not, however, a natural group, for the carpenter-bees
  (<i>Xylocopa</i>) are very different from <i>Anthophora</i>. It has recently been merged by Friese
  with Andrenides into a single group called Podilegidae. Four British genera, <i>Ceratina</i>,
  <i>Anthophora</i>, <i>Eucera</i> and <i>Saropoda</i> (including, however, only seven <span
  class="pagenum" id="page33"><span class="smaller">{33}</span></span>species), are referred to the
  Scopulipedes; in some forms a considerable resemblance to the Bombi is exhibited, indeed the
  female of one of our species of <i>Anthophora</i> is so very like the worker of <i>Bombus
  hortorum</i> var. <i>harrisellus</i>, that it would puzzle any one to distinguish them by a
  superficial inspection, the colour of the hair on the hind legs being the only obvious difference.
  <i>Anthophora</i> is one of the most extensive and widely distributed of the genera of bees. Some
  of the species make burrows in cliffs and form large colonies which are continued for many years
  in the same locality. Friese has published many details of the industry and metamorphoses of some
  of the species of this genus; the most remarkable point he has discovered being that <i>A.
  personata</i> at Strasburg takes two years to accomplish the life-cycle of one generation. Some of
  the European species of the genus have been found to be very subject to the attacks of parasites.
  An anomalous beetle, <i>Sitaris</i>, has been found in the nests of <i>A. pilipes</i>; and this
  same <i>Anthophora</i> is also parasitised by another beetle, <i>Meloe</i>, as well as by a bee of
  the genus <i>Melecta</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Xylocopa</i><a id="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> contains many of the
  largest and most powerful of the bees, and is very widely distributed over the earth. In Europe
  only four or five species have been found, and none of them extend far northwards, <i>X.
  violacea</i> being the only one that comes so far as Paris. They are usually black or blue-black
  in colour, of broad, robust build, with shining integuments more or less covered with hair. <i>X.
  violacea</i> is known as the carpenter-bee from its habit of working in dry wood; it does not
  touch living timber, but will form its nest in all sorts of dried wood. It makes a cylindrical
  hole, and this gives access to three or four parallel galleries in which the broad cells are
  placed; the cells are always isolated by a partition; the bee forms this by cementing together
  with the products of its salivary glands the fragments of wood it cuts out. Its habits have been
  described at length by R&eacute;aumur, who alludes to it under the name of "abeille perce-bois." This bee
  hibernates in the imago condition, both sexes reappearing in the spring. Possibly there is more
  than one generation in the year, as R&eacute;aumur states that specimens that were tiny larvae on the
  12th of June had by the 2nd of July consumed all their stock of provisions; they then fasted for a
  few days, and on the 7th or 8th of July became pupae, and in the first <span class="pagenum"
  id="page34"><span class="smaller">{34}</span></span>days of August were ready to emerge as perfect
  Insects. Thus the whole cycle of metamorphoses is passed through in about eight weeks. This
  species, though very clever in drilling holes, does not hesitate to appropriate old burrows should
  they be at hand. Fabre observed that it was also quite willing to save itself labour by forming
  its cells in hollow reeds of sufficient calibre. We have figured the larva and pupa of this
  species in the previous volume (p. 170).</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Xylocopa chloroptera</i> in E. India selects a hollow bamboo for its nidus; it cements
  together the pieces obtained in clearing out the bamboo, and uses them as horizontal partitions to
  separate the tube into cells. The species is much infested with a small Chalcid of the genus
  <i>Encyrtus</i>: 300 specimens of the parasite have been reared from a single larva of the bee;
  two-thirds of the larvae of this bee that Horne endeavoured to rear were destroyed by the little
  Chalcid.</p>

  <p>The most beautiful and remarkable of all the bees are the species of <i>Euglossa</i>. This
  genus is peculiar to Tropical America, and derives its name from the great length of the
  proboscis, which in some species surpasses that of the body. The colours in <i>Euglossa</i> proper
  are violet, purple, golden, and metallic green, and two of these are frequently combined in the
  most harmonious manner; the hind tibia is greatly developed and forms a plate, the outer surface
  of which is highly polished, while the margins are furnished with rigid hairs. Very little is
  known as to the habits of these bees; they were formerly supposed to be <span class="pagenum"
  id="page35"><span class="smaller">{35}</span></span>social; but this is doubtful, Bates having
  recorded that <i>E. surinamensis</i> forms a "solitary nest." Lucas concluded that <i>E.
  cordata</i> is social, on the authority of a nest containing "a dozen individuals." No workers are
  known. The species of <i>Eulema</i> have a shorter tongue than <i>Euglossa</i>, and in form and
  colour a good deal resemble our species of <i>Bombus</i> and <i>Apathus</i>.</p>

  <p>The group Dasygastres includes seven European genera, four being British (<i>Chelostoma</i>
  being included in <i>Heriades</i>). The ventral surface of the hind body is densely set in the
  females with regularly arranged hairs, by means of which the pollen is carried. In many of the
  Dasygastres (<i>Megachile</i>, <i>e.g.</i>) the labrum is very large, and in repose is inflected
  on to the lower side of the head, and closely applied to the doubled-in tongue, which it serves to
  protect; the mandibles then lock together outside the labrum, which is thus completely concealed.
  This group includes some of the most interesting of the solitary bees.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Chalicodoma</i> is not found in our own country, but in the South of France there
  exist three or four species. Their habits have given rise to much discussion, having been
  described by various naturalists, among whom are included R&eacute;aumur and Fabre. These Insects are
  called mason-bees, and construct nests of very solid masonry. <i>C. muraria</i> is in appearance
  somewhat intermediate between a honey-bee and a <i>Bombus</i>; it is densely hairy, and the sexes
  are very different in colour. It is solitary in its habits, and usually chooses a large stone as a
  solid basis for its habitation. On this a cell is formed, the material used being a kind of cement
  made by the Insect from the mixture of a <span class="pagenum" id="page36"><span
  class="smaller">{36}</span></span>suitable sort of earth with the material secreted by its own
  salivary glands; the amount of cement used is reduced by the artifice of building small stones
  into the walls of the cell; the stones are selected with great care. When a cell about an inch in
  depth has been formed in this manner, the bee commences to fill it with food, consisting of honey
  and pollen; a little honey is brought and is discharged into the cell, then some pollen is added.
  This bee, like other Dasygastres, carries the pollen by means of hairs on the under surface of the
  body; to place this pollen in the cell the Insect therefore enters backwards, and then with the
  pair of hind legs brushes and scrapes the under surface of the body so as to make the pollen fall
  off into the cell; it then starts for a fresh cargo; after a few loads have been placed in the
  receptacle, the Insect mixes the honey and pollen into a paste with the mandibles, and again
  continues its foraging until it has about half filled the cell; then an egg is laid, and the
  apartment is at once closed with cement. This work is all accomplished, if the weather be
  favourable, in about two days, after which the Insect commences the formation of a second cell,
  joined to the first, and so on till eight or nine of these receptacles have been constructed; then
  comes the final operation of adding an additional protection in the shape of a thick layer of
  mortar placed over the whole; the construction, when thus completed, forms a sort of dome of
  cement about the size of half an orange. In this receptacle the larvae pass many months, exposed
  to the extreme heat of summer as well as to the cold of winter. The larvae, however, are exposed
  to numerous other perils; and we have already related (vol. v. p. 540) how <i>Leucospis gigas</i>
  succeeds in perforating the masonry and depositing therein an egg, so that a <i>Leucospis</i> is
  reared in the cell instead of a <i>Chalicodoma</i>.</p>

  <p>This Insect has been the object of some of J. H. Fabre's most instructive studies on
  instinct.<a id="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Although it is impossible for us here to
  consider in a thorough manner the various points he has discussed, yet some of them are of such
  interest and importance as to demand something more than a passing allusion.</p>

  <p>We have mentioned that the nest of <i>Chalicodoma</i> is roofed with a layer of solid cement in
  addition to the first covering with which the bee seals up each cell. When the metamorphoses of
  the imprisoned larva have been passed through, and the moment for its emergence as a perfect
  Insect has arrived, the prisoner has to make its way through the solid wall by which it is
  encompassed. Usually it finds no difficulty in accomplishing the task of breaking through the
  roof, so that the powers of its mandibles must be very great. R&eacute;aumur has, however, recorded that
  a nest of this mason-bee was placed under a glass funnel, the orifice of which was covered with
  gauze, and that the Insects when they emerged from the nest were unable to make their way through
  the gauze, and consequently perished under the glass cover; and he concluded that such insects are
  only able to accomplish the tasks that naturally fall to their lot. By some fresh experiments
  Fabre, however, has put the facts in a different light. He remarks that when the Insects have, in
  the ordinary course of emergence, perforated the walls of their dark prison, they find themselves
  in the daylight, and at liberty to walk away; when they have made their escape from a nest placed
  under a glass cover, they, having no knowledge of glass, find themselves in daylight and
  imprisoned by the glass, which, to their inexperience, does not appear to be an obstacle, and they
  therefore, he thought, might perhaps exhaust themselves in vain efforts to pass through this
  invisible obstacle. He therefore took some cocoons containing pupae from a nest, placed each one
  of them in a tube of reed, and stopped the ends of the reeds with various substances, in one case
  earth, in another pith, in a third brown paper; the reeds were then so arranged that the Insects
  in them were in a natural position; in due course all the Insects emerged, none of them apparently
  having found the novel nature of the obstacle a serious impediment. Some complete nests were then
  taken with their inmates, and to the exterior of one of them a sheet of opaque paper was closely
  fastened, while to another the same <span class="pagenum" id="page38"><span
  class="smaller">{38}</span></span>sort of paper was applied in the form of a dome, leaving thus a
  considerable space between the true cover of the nest and the covering of paper. From the first
  nest the Insects made their escape in the usual manner, thus again proving that paper can be
  easily pierced by them. From the second nest they also liberated themselves, but failed to make
  their way out through the dome of paper, and perished beneath it; thus showing that paper added to
  the natural wall caused them no difficulty, but that paper separated therefrom by a space was an
  insuperable obstacle. Professor P&eacute;rez has pointed out that this is no doubt due to the large space
  offered to the bee, which consequently moves about, and does not concentrate its efforts on a
  single spot, as it of course is compelled to do when confined in its natural cell.</p>

  <p>The power of the mason-bee to find its nest again when removed to a distance from it is another
  point that was tested by Du Hamel and recounted by R&eacute;aumur. As regards this Fabre has also made
  some very valuable observations. He marked some specimens of the bee, and under cover removed them
  to a distance of four kilometres, and then liberated them; the result proved that the bees easily
  found their way back again, and indeed were so little discomposed by the removal that they reached
  their nests laden with pollen as if they had merely been out on an ordinary journey. On one of
  these occasions he observed that a <i>Chalicodoma</i>, on returning, found that another bee had
  during her absence taken possession of her partially completed cell, and was unwilling to
  relinquish it; whereupon a battle between the two took place. The account of this is specially
  interesting, because it would appear that the two combatants did not seek to injure one another,
  but were merely engaged in testing, as it were, which was the more serious in its claims to the
  proprietorship of the cell in dispute. The matter ended by the original constructor regaining and
  retaining possession. Fabre says that in the case of <i>Chalicodoma</i> it is quite a common thing
  for an uncompleted cell to be thus appropriated by a stranger during the absence of the rightful
  owner, and that after a scene of the kind described above, the latter of the two claimants always
  regains possession, thus leading one to suppose that some sense of rightful ownership exists in
  these bees; the usurper expressing, as it were, by its actions the idea&mdash;Before I <span
  class="pagenum" id="page39"><span class="smaller">{39}</span></span>resign my claims I must
  require you to go through the exertions that will prove you to be really the lawful owner.</p>

  <p>Another experiment was made with forty specimens of <i>Chalicodoma pyrenaica</i>, which were
  removed to a distance of four kilometres and then liberated. About twenty of the individuals had
  been somewhat injured by the processes of capturing, marking, and transferring, and proved unable
  to make a proper start. The others went off well when released, and in forty minutes the arrivals
  at the nest had already commenced. The next morning he was able to ascertain that fifteen at least
  had found their way back, and that it was probable that most of the uninjured bees had reached
  home; and this although, as Fabre believed, they had never before seen the spot where he liberated
  them.</p>

  <p>These observations on the power of <i>Chalicodoma</i> to regain its nest attracted the
  attention of Charles Darwin, who wrote to M. Fabre, and suggested that further observations should
  be made with the view of ascertaining by means of what sense these bees were able to accomplish
  their return. For it must be borne in mind that this bee is very different from the domestic bee,
  inasmuch as it enjoys but a brief life in the winged state, and it is therefore to be presumed
  that an individual has no knowledge of such comparatively distant localities as those to which
  Fabre transported it. Further observations made by the Frenchman have unfortunately failed to
  throw any light on this point. Darwin thought it might possibly be some sensitiveness to magnetic
  conditions that enabled the bees to return home, and suggested that they should be tested as to
  this. Fabre accordingly made some minute magnets, and fixed one to each bee previous to letting
  them loose for a return journey. This had the effect of completely deranging the bees; and it was
  therefore at first thought that the requisite clue was obtained. It occurred to the experimenter,
  however, to try the plan of affixing small pieces of straw to the bees instead of magnets, and on
  this being done it was found that the little creatures were just as much deranged by the straws as
  they were by the magnets: thus it became evident that no good grounds exist for considering that
  the bees are guided by magnetic influences.</p>

  <p>One of the species<a id="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> of <i>Chalicodoma</i>
  observed by Fabre fixes <span class="pagenum" id="page40"><span
  class="smaller">{40}</span></span>its nests to the small boulders brought down and left by the
  Rhone on the waste places of its banks. This habit afforded Fabre an opportunity of removing the
  nests during the process of construction, and of observing the effect this produced on the
  architects. While a bee that had a nest partially constructed was absent, he removed the stone and
  the nest attached to it from one situation to another near at hand and visible from the original
  site. In a few minutes the bee returned and went straight to the spot where the nest had been;
  finding its home absent it hovered for a little while around the place, and then alighted on the
  vacated position, and walked about thereon in search of the nest; being after some time convinced
  that this was no longer there, it took wing, but speedily returned again to the place and went
  through the same operations. This series of manoeuvres was several times repeated, the return
  always being made to the exact spot where the nest had been originally located; and although the
  bee in the course of its journeys would pass over the nest at a distance of perhaps only a few
  inches, it did not recognise the object it was in search of. If the nest were placed very near to
  the spot it had been removed from&mdash;say at a distance of about a yard&mdash;it might happen
  that the bee would actually come to the stone to which the nest was fixed, would visit the nest,
  would even enter into the cell it had left partially completed, would examine circumspectly the
  boulder, but would always leave it, and again return to the spot where the nest was originally
  situated, and, on finding that the nest was not there, would take its departure altogether from
  the locality. The home must be, for the bee, in the proper situation, or it is not recognised as
  the desired object. Thus we are confronted with the strange fact that the very bee that is able to
  return to its nest from a distance of four kilometres can no longer recognise it when removed only
  a yard from the original position. This extraordinary condition of the memory of the Insect is
  almost inconceivable by us. That the bee should accurately recognise the spot, but that it should
  not recognise the cell it had itself just formed and half-filled with honey-paste, seems to us
  almost incredible; nevertheless, the fact is quite consistent with what we shall subsequently
  relate in the case of the solitary wasp <i>Bembex</i>. A cross experiment was made by taking away
  the stone with the attached nest of the bee while the latter <span class="pagenum"
  id="page41"><span class="smaller">{41}</span></span>was absent, and putting in its place the nest
  of another individual in about the same stage of construction; this nest was at once adopted by
  the bee, which indeed was apparently in no way deranged by the fact that the edifice was the work
  of another. A further experiment was made by transposing the positions of two nests that were very
  near together, so that each bee when returning might be supposed to have a free choice as to which
  nest it would go to. Unhesitatingly each bee selected the nest that, though not its own, was in
  the position where its own had been. This series of experiments seems to prove that the
  <i>Chalcidoma</i> has very little sense as to what is its own property, but, on the other hand,
  has a most keen appreciation of locality. As, however, it might be supposed that the bees were
  deceived by the similarity between the substituted nests, Fabre transposed two nests that were
  extremely different, one consisting of many cells, the other of a single incomplete cell; it was,
  of course, a necessary condition of this experiment that each of the two nests, however different
  in other respects, should possess one cell each in similar stages of construction; and when that
  was the case each bee cheerfully adopted the nest that, though very different to its own, was in
  the right place. This transposition of nests can be rapidly repeated, and thus the same bee may be
  made to go on working at two different nests.</p>

  <p>Suppose, however, that another sort of change be made. Let a nest, consisting of a cell that is
  in an early stage of construction, be taken away, and let there be substituted for it a cell built
  and partially stored with food. It might be supposed that the bee would gladly welcome this
  change, for the adoption of the substituted cell would save it a great deal of work. Not so,
  however; the bee in such a case will take to the substituted cell, but will go on building at it
  although it is already of the full height, and will continue building at it until the cell is made
  as much as a third more than the regulation height. In fact the bee, being in the building stage
  of its operations, goes on building, although in so doing it is carrying on a useless, if not an
  injurious, work. A similar state ensues when the Insect ceases to build and begins to bring
  provisions to the nest; although a substituted cell may contain a sufficient store of food, the
  bee goes on adding to this, though it is wasting its labours in so doing. It should be noted that
  though the bee must go through the <span class="pagenum" id="page42"><span
  class="smaller">{42}</span></span>appropriate stages of its labours whether the result of so doing
  be beneficial or injurious, yet it is nevertheless to some extent controlled by the circumstances,
  for it does not in such cases complete what should have been the full measure of its own
  individual work; it does not, for instance, raise the cell to twice the natural height, but stops
  building when the cell is about one-third larger than usual, as if at that stage the absurdity of
  the situation became manifest to it.</p>

  <p>Fabre's experiments with the <i>Chalicodoma</i> are so extremely instructive as regards the
  nature of instinct in some of the highest Insects, that we must briefly allude to some other of
  his observations even at the risk of wearying the reader who feels but little interest in the
  subject of Insect intelligence.</p>

  <p>Having discovered that a mason-bee that was engaged in the process of construction would go on
  building to an useless or even injurious extent, Fabre tried another experiment to ascertain
  whether a bee that was engaged in the process of provisioning the nest, would do so in conditions
  that rendered its work futile. Taking away a nest with completely built cell that a bee was
  storing with food, he substituted for it one in which the cell was only commenced, and therefore
  incapable of containing food; when the bee with its store of provisions reached this should-be
  receptacle it appeared to be very perplexed, tested the imperfect cell with its antennae, left the
  spot and returned again; repeating this several times it finally went to the cell of some stranger
  to deposit its treasure. In other cases the bee broke open a completed cell, and having done so
  went on bringing provisions to it, although it was already fully provisioned and an egg laid
  therein: finally, the little creature having completed the bringing of this superfluous tale of
  provisions, deposited a second egg, and again sealed up the cell. But in no case does the bee go
  back from the provisioning stage to the building stage until the cycle for one cell of building,
  provisioning, and egg-laying is completed: but when this is the case, the building of a fresh cell
  may be again undertaken. This is a good example of the kind of consecutive necessity that seems to
  be one of the chief features of the instinct of these industrious little animals. Another equally
  striking illustration of these peculiarities of instinct is offered by interfering with the act of
  putting the provisions into the cell. It will be recollected that <span class="pagenum"
  id="page43"><span class="smaller">{43}</span></span>when the bee brings provisions to add to the
  stock, it carries both honey and pollen; in order to deliver these it begins by entering head
  first into the cell and disgorging the honey, then emerging it turns round, enters backwards and
  scrapes off the pollen from its body. If after the honey has been discharged, the bee be
  interfered with and gently removed to a slight distance with a straw, it returns to complete its
  task, but instead of going on with the actions at the point at which the interruption took place,
  it begins the series over again, going in&mdash;at any rate partially&mdash;head first, although
  it has no honey to discharge, and having performed this useless ceremony it then emerges, turns
  round and adds the pollen. This illustration is in some respects the reverse of what might have
  been expected, for the Insect here does not continue the act at the interrupted point, but begins
  the series of actions afresh.</p>

  <p>It would be reasonable to suppose that an Insect that takes the pains to provide for the safety
  of its progeny by constructing a complex edifice of cement, secures thereby the advantage of
  protection for its young. But this is far from being the case. Notwithstanding the cement and the
  thick dome of mortar, the <i>Chalicodoma</i> is extremely subject to the attacks of parasites. The
  work performed by the creature in constructing its mass of masonry is truly astounding; Fabre
  calculated from measurements he made that for the construction and provisioning of a single cell,
  the goings and comings of the bee amounted to 15 kilometres, and it makes for each nest sometimes
  as many as fifteen cells. Notwithstanding all this labour, it would appear that no real safety for
  the larvae is obtained by the work. Some sixteen&mdash;possibly more&mdash;other species of
  Insects get their living off this industrious creature. Another bee, <i>Stelis nasuta</i>, breaks
  open the cells after they have been completely closed and places its own eggs in them, and then
  again closes the cells with mortar. The larvae of this <i>Stelis</i> develop more rapidly than do
  those of the <i>Chalicodoma</i>, so that the result of this shameless proceeding is that the young
  one of the legitimate proprietor&mdash;as we human beings think it&mdash;is starved to death, or
  is possibly eaten up as a dessert by the <i>Stelis</i> larvae, after they have appropriated all
  the pudding.</p>

  <p>Another bee, <i>Dioxys cincta</i>, is even more audacious; it flies about in a careless manner
  among the <i>Chalicodoma</i> at their <span class="pagenum" id="page44"><span
  class="smaller">{44}</span></span>work, and they do not seem to object to its presence unless it
  interferes with them in too unmannerly a fashion, when they brush it aside. The <i>Dioxys</i>,
  when the proprietor leaves the cell, will enter it and taste the contents; after having taken a
  few mouthfuls the impudent creature then deposits an egg in the cell, and, it is pretty certain,
  places it at or near the bottom of the mass of pollen, so that it is not conspicuously evident to
  the <i>Chalicodoma</i> when the bee again returns to add to or complete the stock of provisions.
  Afterwards the constructor deposits its own egg in the cell and closes it. The final result is
  much the same as in the case of the <i>Stelis</i>, that is to say, the <i>Chalicodoma</i> has
  provided food for an usurper; but it appears probable that the consummation is reached in a
  somewhat different manner, namely, by the <i>Dioxys</i> larva eating the egg of the
  <i>Chalicodoma</i>, instead of slaughtering the larva. Two of the Hymenoptera Parasitica are very
  destructive to the <i>Chalicodoma</i>, viz. <i>Leucospis gigas</i> and <i>Monodontomerus
  nitidus</i>; the habits of which we have already discussed (vol. v. p. 543) under Chalcididae.
  Lampert has given a list of the Insects attacking the mason-bee or found in its nests; altogether
  it would appear that about sixteen species have been recognised, most of which destroy the bee
  larva, though some possibly destroy the bee's destroyers, and two or three perhaps merely devour
  dead examples of the bee, or take the food from cells, the inhabitants of which have been
  destroyed by some untoward event. This author thinks that one half of the bees' progeny are made
  away with by these destroyers, while Fabre places the destruction in the South of France at a
  still higher ratio, telling us that in one nest of nine cells, the inhabitants of three were
  destroyed by the Dipterous Insect, <i>Anthrax trifasciata</i>, of two by <i>Leucospis</i>, of two
  by <i>Stelis</i>, and of one by the smaller Chalcid; there being thus only a single example of the
  bee that had not succumbed to one or other of the enemies. He has sometimes examined a large
  number of nests without finding a single one that had not been attacked by one or other of the
  parasites, and more often than not several of the marauders had attacked the nest.</p>

  <p>It is said by Lampert and others that there is a passage in Pliny relating to one of the
  mason-bees, that the Roman author had noticed in the act of carrying off stones to build into its
  nest; being unacquainted with the special habits of the bee, he <span class="pagenum"
  id="page45"><span class="smaller">{45}</span></span>seems to have supposed that the insect was
  carrying the stone as ballast to keep itself from being blown away.</p>

      female.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The bees of the genus <i>Anthidium</i> are known to possess the habit of making nests of wool
  or cotton, that they obtain from plants growing at hand. We have one species of this genus of bees
  in Britain; it sometimes may be seen at work in the grounds of our Museum at Cambridge: it is
  referred to by Gilbert White, who says of it, in his <i>History of Selborne</i>: "There is a sort
  of wild bee frequenting the garden-campion for the sake of its tomentum, which probably it turns
  to some purpose in the business of nidification. It is very pleasant to see with what address it
  strips off the pubes, running from the top to the bottom of a branch, and shaving it bare with the
  dexterity of a hoop-shaver. When it has got a bundle, almost as large as itself, it flies away,
  holding it secure between its chin and its fore legs." The species of this genus are remarkable as
  forming a conspicuous exception to the rule that in bees the female is larger than the male. The
  species of <i>Anthidium</i> do not form burrows for themselves, but either take advantage of
  suitable cavities formed by other Insects in wood, or take possession of deserted nests of other
  bees or even empty snail-shells. The workers in cotton, of which our British species <i>A.
  manicatum</i> is one, line the selected receptacle with a beautiful network of cotton or wool, and
  inside this place a finer layer of the material, to which is added some sort of cement that
  prevents the honied mass stored by the bees in this receptacle from passing out of it. <i>A.
  diadema</i>, one of the species that form nests in hollow stems, has been specially observed by
  Fabre; it will take the cotton for <span class="pagenum" id="page46"><span
  class="smaller">{46}</span></span>its work from any suitable plant growing near its nest, and does
  not confine itself to any particular natural order of plants, or even to those that are indigenous
  to the South of France. When it has brought a ball of cotton to the nest, the bee spreads out and
  arranges the material with its front legs and mandibles, and presses it down with its forehead on
  to the cotton previously deposited; in this way a tube of cotton is constructed inside the reed;
  when withdrawn, the tube proved to be composed of about ten distinct cells arranged in linear
  fashion, and connected firmly together by means of the outer layer of cotton; the transverse
  divisions between the chambers are also formed of cotton, and each chamber is stored with a
  mixture of honey and pollen. The series of chambers does not extend quite to the end of the reed,
  and in the unoccupied space the Insect accumulates small stones, little pieces of earth, fragments
  of wood or other similar small objects, so as to form a sort of barricade in the vestibule, and
  then closes the tube by a barrier of coarser cotton taken frequently from some other plant, the
  mullein by preference. This barricade would appear to be an ingenious attempt to keep out
  parasites, but if so, it is a failure, at any rate as against <i>Leucospis</i>, which insinuates
  its eggs through the sides, and frequently destroys to the last one the inhabitants of the
  fortress. Fabre states that these <i>Anthidium</i>, as well as <i>Megachile</i>, will continue to
  construct cells when they have no eggs to place in them; in such a case it would appear from his
  remarks that the cells are made in due form and the extremity of the reed closed, but no
  provisions are stored in the chambers.</p>

  <p>The larva of the <i>Anthidium</i> forms a most singular cocoon. We have already noticed the
  difficulty that arises, in the case of these Hymenopterous larvae shut up in small chambers, as to
  the disposal of the matters resulting from the incomplete assimilation of the aliment ingested. To
  allow the once-used food to mingle with that still remaining unconsumed would be not only
  disagreeable but possibly fatal to the life of the larva. Hence some species retain the whole of
  the excrement until the food is entirely consumed, it being, according to Adlerz, stored in a
  special pouch at the end of the stomach; other Hymenoptera, amongst which we may mention the
  species of <i>Osmia</i>, place the excreta in a vacant space. The <i>Anthidium</i> adopts,
  however, a most remarkable system: about the middle of its <span class="pagenum" id="page47"><span
  class="smaller">{47}</span></span>larval life it commences the expulsion of "frass" in the shape
  of small pellets, which it fastens together with silk, as they are voided, and suspends round the
  walls of the chamber. This curious arrangement not only results in keeping the embarrassing
  material from contact with the food and with the larva itself, but serves, when the growth of the
  latter is accomplished, as the outline or foundations of the cocoon in which the metamorphosis is
  completed. This cocoon is of a very elaborate character; it has, so says Fabre, a beautiful
  appearance, and is provided with a very peculiar structure in the form of a small conical
  protuberance at one extremity pierced by a canal. This canal is formed with great care by the
  larva, which from time to time places its head in the orifice in process of construction, and
  stretches the calibre by opening the mandibles. The object of this peculiarity in the fabrication
  of the elaborate cocoon is not clear, but Fabre inclines to the opinion that it is for respiratory
  purposes.</p>

  <p>Other species of this genus use resin in place of cotton as their working material. Among these
  are <i>Anthidium septemdentatum</i> and <i>A. bellicosum</i>. The former species chooses an old
  snail-shell as its nidus, and constructs in it near the top a barrier of resin, so as to shut off
  the part where the whorl is too small; then beneath the shelter of this barrier it accumulates a
  store of honey-pollen, deposits an egg, and completes the cell by another transverse barrier of
  resin; two such cells are usually constructed in one snail-shell, and below them is placed a
  barricade of small miscellaneous articles, similar to what we have described in speaking of the
  cotton-working species of the genus. This bee completes its metamorphosis, and is ready to leave
  the cell in early spring. Its congener, <i>A. bellicosum</i>, has the same habits, with the
  exception that it works later in the year, and is thus exposed to a great danger, that very
  frequently proves fatal to it. This bee does not completely occupy the snail-shell with its cells,
  but leaves the lower and larger portion of the shell vacant. Now, there is another bee, a species
  of <i>Osmia</i>, that is also fond of snail-shells as a nesting-place, and that affects the same
  localities as the <i>A. septemdentatum</i>; very often the <i>Osmia</i> selects for its nest the
  vacant part of a shell, the other part of which is occupied by the <i>Anthidium</i>; the result of
  this is that when the metamorphoses are completed, the latter bee is unable to effect its escape,
  and <span class="pagenum" id="page48"><span class="smaller">{48}</span></span>thus perishes in the
  cell. Fabre further states with regard to these interesting bees, that no structural differences
  of the feet or mandibles can be detected between the workers in cotton and the workers in resin;
  and he also says that in the case where two cells are constructed in one snail-shell, a male
  individual is produced from the cell of the greater capacity, and a female from the other.</p>

  <p><i>Osmia</i> is one of the most important of the genera of bees found in Europe, and is
  remarkable for the diversity of instinct displayed in the formation of the nests of the various
  species. As a rule they avail themselves for nidification of hollow places already existing;
  choosing excavations in wood, in the mortar of walls, and even in sandbanks; in several cases the
  same species is found to be able to adapt itself to more than one kind of these very different
  substances. This variety of habit will render it impossible for us to do justice to this
  interesting genus within the space at our disposal, and we must content ourselves with a
  consideration of one or two of the more instructive of the traits of <i>Osmia</i> life. <i>O.
  tridentata</i> forms its nest in the stems of brambles, of which it excavates the pith; its mode
  of working and some other details of its life have been well depicted by Fabre. The Insect having
  selected a suitable bramble-stalk with a cut extremity, forms a cylindrical burrow in the pith
  thereof, extending the tunnel as far as will be required to allow the construction of ten or more
  cells placed one after the other in the axis of the cylinder; the bee does not at first clear out
  quite all the pith, but merely forms a tunnel through it, and then commences the construction of
  the first cell, which is placed at the end of the tunnel that is most remote from the entrance.
  This cavity is to be of oval form, and the Insect therefore cuts away more of the pith so as to
  make an oval space, but somewhat truncate, as it were, at each end, the plane of truncation at the
  proximal extremity being of course an orifice.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig21.jpg"><img style="width:27%" src="images/fig21.jpg" alt="fig21"
    title="fig21" ></a>
    <div class="smaller ac">

    </div>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page49"><span class="smaller">{49}</span></span></div>

  <p>The first cell thus made is stored with pollen and honey, and an egg is deposited. Then a
  barrier has to be constructed to close this chamber; the material used for the barrier is the pith
  of the stem, and the Insect cuts the material required for the purpose from the walls of the
  second chamber; the excavation of the second chamber is, in fact, made to furnish the material for
  closing up the first cell. In this way a chain of cells is constructed, their number being
  sometimes as many as fifteen. The mode in which the bees, when the transformations of the larvae
  and pupae have been completed, escape from the chain of cells, has been the subject of much
  discussion, and errors have arisen from inference being allowed to take the place of observation.
  Thus Dufour, who noted this same mode of construction and arrangement in another Hymenopteron
  (<i>Odynerus nidulator</i>), perceived that there was only one orifice of exit, and also that the
  Insect that was placed at the greatest distance from this was the one that, being the oldest of
  the series, might be expected to be the first ready to emerge; and as the other cocoons would
  necessarily be in the way of its getting out, he concluded that the egg that was last laid
  produced the first Insect ready for emergence. Fabre tested this by some ingenious experiments,
  and found that this was not the case, but that the Insects became ready to leave their place of
  imprisonment without any reference to the order in which the eggs were laid, and he further
  noticed some very curious facts with reference to the mode of emergence of <i>Osmia
  tridentata</i>. Each Insect, when it desires to leave the bramble stem, tears open the cocoon in
  which it is enclosed, and also bites through the barrier placed by the mother between it and the
  Insect that is next it, and that separates it from the orifice of exit. Of course, if it happen to
  be the outside one of the series it can then escape at once; but if it should be one farther down
  in the Indian file it will not touch the cocoon beyond, but waits patiently, possibly for days; if
  it then still find itself confined it endeavours to escape by squeezing past the cocoon that
  intervenes between it and liberty, and by biting away the material at the sides so as to enlarge
  the passage; it may succeed in doing this, and so get out, but if it fail to make a side passage
  it will not touch the cocoons that are in its way. In the ordinary course of events, supposing all
  to go well with the family, all the cocoons produce their inmates in a state for emergence within
  <span class="pagenum" id="page50"><span class="smaller">{50}</span></span>a week or two, and so
  all get out. Frequently, however, the emergence is prevented by something having gone wrong with
  one of the outer Insects, in which case all beyond it perish unless they are strong enough to bite
  a hole through the sides of the bramble-stem. Thus it appears that whether a particular
  <i>Osmia</i> shall be able to emerge or not depends on two things&mdash;(1) whether all goes well
  with all the other Insects between it and the orifice, and (2) whether the Insect can bite a
  lateral hole or not; this latter point also largely depends on the thickness of the outer part of
  the stem of the bramble. Fabre's experiments on these points have been repeated, and his results
  confirmed by Nicolas.</p>

  <p>The fact that an <i>Osmia</i> would itself perish rather than attack the cocoon of its brother
  or sister is certainly very remarkable, and it induced Fabre to make some further experiments. He
  took some cocoons containing dead specimens of <i>Osmia</i>, and placed them in the road of an
  <i>Osmia</i> ready for exit, and found that in such case the bee made its way out by demolishing
  without any scruple the cocoons and dead larvae that intervened between it and liberty. He then
  took some other reeds, and blocked the way of exit with cocoons containing living larvae, but of
  another species of Hymenoptera. <i>Solenius vagus</i> and <i>Osmia detrita</i> were the species
  experimented on in this case, and he found that the <i>Osmia</i> destroyed the cocoon and living
  larvae of the <i>Solenius</i>, and so made its way out. Thus it appears that <i>Osmia</i> will
  respect the life of its own species, and die rather than destroy it, but has no similar respect
  for the life of another species.</p>

  <p>Some of Fabre's most instructive chapters are devoted to the habits and instincts of various
  species of the genus <i>Osmia</i>. It is impossible here to find space even to summarise them,
  still more impossible to do them justice; but we have selected the history just recounted, because
  it is rare to find in the insect world instances of such self-sacrifice by an individual for one
  of the same generation. It would be quite improper to generalise from this case, however, and
  conclude that such respect for its own species is common even amongst the Osmia. Fabre, indeed,
  relates a case that offers a sad contrast to the scene of self-sacrifice and respect for the
  rights of others that we have roughly portrayed. He was able to induce a colony of <i>Osmia
  tricornis</i> (another species of the genus, be it noted) to establish itself and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page51"><span class="smaller">{51}</span></span>work in a series of glass
  tubes that he placed on a table in his laboratory. He marked various individuals, so that he was
  able to recognise them and note the progress of their industrial works. Quite a large number of
  specimens thus established themselves and concluded their work before his very eyes. Some
  individuals, however, when they had completed the formation of a series of cells in a glass tube
  or in a reed, had still not entirely completed their tale of work. It would be supposed that in
  such a case the individual would commence the formation of another series of cells in an
  unoccupied tube. This was not, however, the case. The bee preferred tearing open one or more cells
  already completed&mdash;in some cases, even by itself&mdash;scattering the contents, and devouring
  the egg; then again provisioning the cell, it would deposit a fresh egg, and close the chamber.
  These brief remarks will perhaps suffice to give some idea of the variety of instinct and habit
  that prevails in this very interesting genus. Friese observes that the variety of habits in this
  genus is accompanied as a rule by paucity of individuals of a species, so that in central Europe a
  collector must be prepared to give some twenty years or so of attention to the genus before he can
  consider he has obtained all the species of <i>Osmia</i> that inhabit his district.</p>

  <p>As a prelude to the remarks we are about to make on the leaf-cutting bees of the genus
  <i>Megachile</i> it is well to state that the bee, the habits of which were described by R&eacute;aumur
  under the name of "l'abeille tapissi&egrave;re," and that uses portions of the leaves of the scarlet
  poppy to line its nest, is now assigned to the genus <i>Osmia</i>, although Latreille, in the
  interval that has elapsed since the publication of R&eacute;aumur's work, founded the genus
  <i>Anthocopa</i> for the bee in question. <i>Megachile</i> is one of the most important of the
  genera of the Dasygastres, being found in most parts of the world, even in the Sandwich Islands;
  it consists of bees averaging about the size of the honey-bee (though some are considerably
  larger, others smaller), and having the labrum largely developed; this organ is capable of
  complete inflection to the under side of the head, and when in the condition of repose it is thus
  infolded, it underlaps and protects the larger part of the lower lip; the mandibles close over the
  infolded labrum, so that, when the Insect is at rest, this appears to be altogether absent. These
  bees are called leaf-cutters, from their habit of forming the cells for their nest <span
  class="pagenum" id="page52"><span class="smaller">{52}</span></span>out of pieces of the leaves of
  plants. We have several species in Britain; they are very like the common honey-bee in general
  appearance, though rather more robustly formed. These Insects, like the Osmiae, avail themselves
  of existing hollow places as receptacles in which to place their nests. <i>M. albocincta</i>
  frequently takes possession of a deserted worm-burrow in the ground. The burrow being longer than
  necessary the bee commences by cutting off the more distant part by means of a barricade of
  foliage; this being done, it proceeds to form a series of cells, each shaped like a thimble with a
  lid at the open end (Fig. 22, A). The body of the thimble is formed of large oval pieces of leaf,
  the lid of smaller round pieces; the fragments are cut with great skill from the leaves of growing
  plants by the Insect, which seems to have an idea of the form and size of the piece of foliage
  necessary for each particular stage of its work.</p>

  <p>Horne has given particulars as to the nest of <i>Megachile anthracina</i> (<i>fasciculata</i>),
  an East Indian species.<a id="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> The material employed was
  either the leaves of the Indian pulse or of the rose. Long pieces are cut by the Insect from the
  leaf, and with these a cell is formed; a circular piece is next cut, and with this a lid is made
  for the receptacle. The cells are about the size and shape of a common thimble; in one specimen
  that Horne examined no less than thirty-two pieces of leaf disposed in seven layers were used for
  one cell, in addition to three pieces for the round top. The cells are carefully prepared, and
  some kind of matter of a gummy nature is believed to be used to keep in place the pieces forming
  the interior layers. The cells are placed end to end, as shown in Fig. 22, B; five to seven cells
  form a series, and four or six series are believed to be constructed by one pair <span
  class="pagenum" id="page53"><span class="smaller">{53}</span></span>of this bee, the mass being
  located in a hollow in masonry or some similar position. Each cell when completed is half filled
  with pollen in the usual manner, and an egg is then laid in it. This bee is much infested by
  parasites, and is eaten by the Grey Hornbill (<i>Meniceros bicornis</i>).</p>

  <p><i>Megachile lanata</i> is one of the Hymenoptera that in East India enter houses to build
  their own habitations. According to Horne both sexes take part in the work of construction, and
  the spots chosen are frequently of a very odd nature. The material used is some kind of clay, and
  the natural situation may be considered to be the interior of a hollow tube, such as the stem of a
  bamboo; but the barrel of a gun, and the hollow in the back of a book that has been left lying
  open, have been occasionally selected by the Insect as suitable. Smith states that the individuals
  developed in the lower part of a tubular series of this species were females, "which sex takes
  longer to develop, and thus an exit is not required for them so soon as for the occupants of the
  upper cells which are males." <i>M. proxima</i>, a species almost exactly similar in appearance to
  <i>M. lanata</i>, makes its cells of leaf-cuttings, however, and places them in soft soil.</p>

  <p>Fabre states that <i>M. albocincta</i>, which commences the formation of its nest in a
  worm-burrow by means of a barricade, frequently makes the barricade, but no nest; sometimes it
  will indeed make the barricade more than twice the proper size, and thus completely fill up the
  worm burrow. Fabre considers that these eccentric proceedings are due to individuals that have
  already formed proper nests elsewhere, and that after completing these have still some strength
  remaining, which they use up in this fruitless manner.</p>

  <p>The <b>Social bees</b> (Sociales) include, so far as is yet known, only a very small number of
  genera, and are so diverse, both in habits and structure, that the propriety of associating them
  in one group is more than doubtful; the genera are <i>Bombus</i> (Fig. 331, vol. v.), with its
  commensal genus or section, <i>Psithyrus</i> (Fig. 23); <i>Melipona</i> (Fig. 24), in which
  <i>Trigona</i> and <i>Tetragona</i> may at present be included, and <i>Apis</i> (Fig. 6); this
  latter genus comprising the various honey-bees that are more or less completely domesticated in
  different parts of the world.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Bombus</i> the phenomena connected with the social life are more similar to
  what we find among wasps <span class="pagenum" id="page54"><span
  class="smaller">{54}</span></span>than to what they are in the genus <i>Apis</i>. The societies
  come to an end at the close of the season, a few females live through the winter, and each of
  these starts a new colony in the following spring. Males, females and workers exist, but the
  latter are not distinguished by any good characters from the females, and are, in fact, nothing
  but more or less imperfect forms thereof; whereas in <i>Apis</i> the workers are distinguished by
  structural characters not found in either of the true sexes.</p>

  <p>Hoffer has given a description of the commencement of a society of <i>Bombus lapidarius</i>.<a
  id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> A large female, at the end of May, collected
  together a small mass of moss, then made an expedition and returned laden with pollen; under cover
  of the moss a cell was formed of wax taken from the hind-body and mixed with the pollen the bee
  had brought in; this cell was fastened to a piece of wood; when completed it formed a subspherical
  receptacle, the outer wall of which consisted of wax, and whose interior was lined with
  honey-saturated pollen; then several eggs were laid in this receptacle, and it was entirely
  closed. Hoffer took the completed cell away to use it for museum purposes, and the following day
  the poor bee that had formed it died. From observations made on <i>Bombus agrorum</i> he was able
  to describe the subsequent operations; these are somewhat as follows:&mdash;The first cell being
  constructed, stored, and closed, the industrious architect, clinging to the cell, takes a few
  days' rest, and after this interval commences the formation of a second cell; this is placed by
  the side of the first, to which it is connected by a mixture of wax and pollen; the second cell
  being completed a third may be formed; but the labours of the constructor about this time are
  augmented by the hatching of the eggs deposited a few days previously; for the young larvae,
  having soon disposed of the small quantity of food in the interior of the waxen cell, require
  feeding. This operation is carried on by forming a small opening in the upper part of the cell,
  through which the bee conveys food to the interior by ejecting it from her mouth through the hole;
  whether the food is conveyed directly to the mouths of the larvae or not, Hoffer was unable to
  observe; it being much more difficult to approach this royal founder without disturbing her than
  it is the worker-bees that carry on similar occupations at a subsequent period in the history of
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page55"><span class="smaller">{55}</span></span>society. The larvae
  in the first cell, as they increase in size, apparently distend the cell in an irregular manner,
  so that it becomes a knobbed and rugged, truffle-like mass. The same thing happens with the other
  cells formed by the queen. Each of these larval masses contains, it should be noticed,
  sister-larvae all of one age; when full grown they pupate in the mass, and it is worthy of remark
  that although all the eggs in one larval mass were laid at the same time, yet the larvae do not
  all pupate simultaneously, neither do all the perfect Insects appear at once, even if all are of
  one sex. The pupation takes place in a cocoon that each larva forms for itself of excessively fine
  silk. The first broods hatched are formed chiefly, if not entirely, of workers, but small females
  may be produced before the end of the season. Huber and Schmiedeknecht state that though the queen
  provides the worker-cells with food before the eggs are placed therein, yet no food is put in the
  cells in which males and females are produced. The queen, at the time of pupation of the larvae,
  scrapes away the wax by which the cocoons are covered, thus facilitating the escape of the perfect
  Insect, and, it may also be, aiding the access of air to the pupa. The colony at first grows very
  slowly, as the queen can, unaided, feed only a small number of larvae. But after she receives the
  assistance of the first batch of workers much more rapid progress is made, the queen greatly
  restricting her labours, and occupying herself with the laying of eggs; a process that now
  proceeds more and more rapidly, the queen in some cases scarcely ever leaving the nest, and in
  others even becoming incapable of flight. The females produced during the intermediate period of
  the colony are smaller than the mother, but supplement her in the process of egg-laying, as also
  do the workers to a greater or less extent. The conditions that determine the egg-laying powers of
  these small females and workers are apparently unknown, but it is ascertained that these powers
  vary greatly in different cases, so that if the true queen die the continuation of the colony is
  sometimes effectively carried on by these her former subordinates. In other cases, however, the
  reverse happens, and none of the inhabitants may be capable of producing eggs: in this event two
  conditions may be present; either larvae may exist in the nest, or they may be absent. In the
  former case the workers provide them with food, and the <span class="pagenum" id="page56"><span
  class="smaller">{56}</span></span>colony may thus still be continued; but in the latter case,
  there being no profitable occupation for the bees to follow, they spend the greater part of the
  time sitting at home in the nest.</p>

  <p>Supposing all to go well with the colony it increases very greatly, but its prosperity is
  checked in the autumn; at this period large numbers of males are produced as well as new queens,
  and thereafter the colony comes to an end, only a few fertilised females surviving the winter,
  each one to commence for herself a new colony in the ensuing spring.</p>

  <p>The interior of the nest of a bumble-bee (<i>Bombus</i>) frequently presents a very irregular
  appearance; this is largely owing to the fact that these bees do not use the cells as cradles
  twice, but form others as they may be required, on the old remains. The cells, moreover, are of
  different sizes, those that produce workers being the smallest, those that cradle females being
  the largest, while those in which males are reared are intermediate in size. Although the old
  cells are not used a second time for rearing brood they are nevertheless frequently adapted to the
  purposes of receptacles for pollen and for honey, and for these objects they may be increased in
  size and altered in form.</p>

  <p>It may be gathered from various records that the period required to complete the development of
  the individual <i>Bombus</i> about midsummer is four weeks from the deposition of the egg to the
  emergence of the perfect Insect, but exact details and information as to whether this period
  varies with the sex of the Insect developed are not to be found. The records do not afford any
  reason for supposing that such distinction will be found to exist: the size of the cells appears
  the only correlation, suggested by the facts yet known, between the sex of the individual and the
  circumstances of development.</p>

  <p>The colonies of <i>Bombus</i> vary greatly in prosperity, if we take as the test of this the
  number of individuals produced in a colony. They never, however, attain anything at all
  approaching to the vast number of individuals that compose a large colony of wasps, or that exist
  in the crowded societies of the more perfectly social bees. A populous colony of a subterranean
  <i>Bombus</i> may attain the number of 300 or 400 individuals. Those that dwell on the surface are
  as a rule much less populous, as they are less protected, so that changes of weather are more
  <span class="pagenum" id="page57"><span class="smaller">{57}</span></span>prejudicial to them.
  According to Smith, the average number of a colony of <i>B. muscorum</i> in the autumn in this
  country is about 120&mdash;viz. 25 females, 36 males, 59 workers. No mode of increasing the nests
  in a systematic manner exists in this genus; they do not place the cells in stories as the wasps
  do; and this is the case notwithstanding the fact that a cell is not twice used for the rearing of
  young. When the ground-space available for cell-building is filled the <i>Bombus</i> begins
  another series of cells on the ruins of the first one. From this reason old nests have a very
  irregular appearance, and this condition of seeming disorder is greatly increased by the very
  different sizes of the cells themselves. We have already alluded to some of these cells, more
  particularly to those of different capacities to suit the sexes of the individuals to be reared in
  them. In addition to these there are honey-tubs, pollen-tubs, and the cells of the
  <i>Psithyrus</i> (Fig. 23), the parasitic but friendly inmates of the <i>Bombus</i>-nests. A nest
  of <i>Bombus</i>, exhibiting the various pots projecting from the remains of empty and partially
  destroyed cells, presents, as may well be imagined, a very curious appearance. Some of the old
  cells apparently are partly destroyed for the sake of the material they are composed of. Others
  are formed into honey-tubs, of a make-shift nature. It must be recollected that, as a colony
  increases, stores of provisions become absolutely necessary, otherwise in bad weather the larvae
  could not be fed. In good weather, and when flowers abound, these bees collect and store honey in
  abundance; in addition to placing it in the empty pupa-cells, they also form for it special
  receptacles; these are delicate cells made entirely of wax filled with honey, and are always left
  open for the benefit of the community. The existence of these honey-tubs in bumble-bees' nests has
  become known to our country urchins, whose love for honey and for the sport of bee-baiting leads
  to wholesale destruction of the nests. According to Hoffer, special tubs for the storing of pollen
  are sometimes formed; these are much taller than the other cells. The <i>Psithyrus</i> that live
  in the nests with the <i>Bombus</i> are generally somewhat larger than the latter, and
  consequently their cells may be distinguished in the nests by their larger size. A bumble-bees'
  nest, composed of all these heterogenous chambers rising out of the ruins of former layers of
  cells, presents a scene of such apparent disorder that <span class="pagenum" id="page58"><span
  class="smaller">{58}</span></span>many have declared that the bumble-bees do not know how to
  build.</p>

  <p>Although the species of <i>Bombus</i> are not comparable with the hive-bee in respect of the
  perfection and intelligent nature of their work, yet they are very industrious Insects, and the
  construction of the dwelling-places of the subterranean species is said to be carried out in some
  cases with considerable skill, a dome of wax being formed as a sort of roof over the brood cells.
  Some work even at night. Fea has recorded the capture of a species in Upper Burmah working by
  moonlight, and the same industry may be observed in this country if there be sufficient heat as
  well as light. Godart, about 200 years ago, stated that a trumpeter-bee is kept in some nests to
  rouse the denizens to work in the morning: this has been treated as a fable by subsequent writers,
  but is confirmed in a circumstantial manner by Hoffer, who observed the performance in a nest of
  <i>B. ruderatus</i> in his laboratory. On the trumpeter being taken away its office was the
  following morning filled by another individual The trumpeting was done as early as three or four
  o'clock in the morning, and it is by no means impossible that the earliness of the hour may have
  had something to do with the fact that for 200 years no one confirmed the old naturalist's
  observation.</p>

  <p>One of the most curious facts in connection with <i>Bombus</i> is the excessive variation that
  many of the species display in the colour of the beautiful hair with which they are so abundantly
  provided. There is not only usually a difference between the sexes in this respect, but also
  extreme variation within the limits of the same sex, more especially in the case of the males and
  workers; there is also an astonishing difference in the size of individuals. These variations are
  carried to such an extent that it is almost impossible to discriminate all the varieties of a
  species by inspection of the superficial characters. The structures peculiar to the male, as well
  as the sting of the female, enable the species to be determined with tolerable certainty.
  Cholodkovsky,<a id="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> on whose authority this statement as
  to the sting is made, has not examined it in the workers, so that we do not know whether it is as
  invariable in them as he states it to be in queens of the same species. According to Handlirsch,<a
  id="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> each <span class="pagenum" id="page59"><span
  class="smaller">{59}</span></span>species of <i>Bombus</i> has the capacity of variation, and many
  of the varieties are found in one nest, that is, among the offspring of a single pair of the
  species, but many of the variations are restricted to certain localities. Some of the forms can be
  considered as actual ("fertige") species, intermediate forms not being found, and even the
  characters by which species are recognised being somewhat modified. As examples of this he
  mentions <i>Bombus silvarum</i> and <i>B. arenicola</i>, <i>B. pratorum</i> and <i>B.
  scrimshiranus</i>. In other cases, however, the varieties are not so discontinuous, intermediate
  forms being numerous; this condition is more common than the one we have previously described;
  <i>B. terrestris</i>, <i>B. hortorum</i>, <i>B. lapidarius</i> and <i>B. pomorum</i> are examples
  of these variable species. The variation runs to a considerable extent in parallel lines in the
  different species, there being a dark and a light form of each; also each species that has a white
  termination to the body appears in a form with a red termination, and <i>vice versa</i>. In the
  Caucasus many species that have everywhere else yellow bands possess them white; and in Corsica
  there are species that are entirely black, with a red termination to the body, though in
  continental Europe the same species exhibit yellow bands and a white termination to the body. With
  so much variation it will be readily believed that much remains to be done in the study of this
  fascinating genus. It is rich in species in the Northern hemisphere, but poor in the Southern one,
  and in both the Ethiopian and Australian regions it is thought to be entirely wanting.</p>

  <p>The species of the genus <i>Psithyrus</i> (<i>Apathus</i> of many authors) inhabit the nests of
  <i>Bombus</i>; although less numerous than the species of the latter genus, they also are widely
  distributed. They are so like <i>Bombus</i> in appearance that they were not distinguished from
  them by the earlier entomologists; and what is still more remarkable, each species of
  <i>Psithyrus</i> resembles the <i>Bombus</i> with which it usually lives. There appear, however,
  to be occasional exceptions to this rule, Smith having seen one of the yellow-banded
  <i>Psithyrus</i> in the nest of a red-tailed <i>Bombus</i>. <i>Psithyrus</i> is chiefly
  distinguished from <i>Bombus</i> by the absence of certain characters that fit the latter Insects
  for their industrial life; the hind tibiae have no smooth space for the conveyance of pollen, and,
  so far as is known, there are only two sexes, males and perfect females.</p>

  <p>The <i>Bombus</i> and <i>Psithyrus</i> live together on the best terms, and it appears probable
  that the latter do the former no harm beyond appropriating a portion of their food supplies.
  Schmiedeknecht says they are commensals, not parasites; but it must be admitted that singularly
  few descriptions of the habits and life-histories of these interesting Insects have been recorded.
  Hoffer has, however, made a few direct observations which confirm, and at the same time make more
  definite, the vague ideas that have been generally prevalent among entomologists. He found and
  took home a nest of <i>Bombus variabilis</i>, which contained also a female of <i>Psithyrus
  campestris</i>, so that he was able to make observations on the two. The <i>Psithyrus</i> was much
  less industrious than the <i>Bombus</i>, and only left the nest somewhat before noon, returning
  home again towards evening; after about a month this specimen became still more inactive, and
  passed entire days in the nest, occupying itself in consuming the stores of honey of its hosts, of
  which very large quantities were absorbed, the <i>Psithyrus</i> being much larger than the
  host-bee. The cells in which the young of the <i>Psithyrus</i> are hatched are very much larger
  than those of the <i>Bombus</i>, and, it may therefore be presumed, are formed by the
  <i>Psithyrus</i> itself, for it can scarcely be supposed that the <i>Bombus</i> carries its
  complaisance so far as to construct a cell specially adapted to the superior stature of its
  uninvited boarder. When a <i>Psithyrus</i> has been for some time a regular inhabitant of a nest,
  the <i>Bombus</i> take its return home from time to time as a matter of course, displaying no
  emotion whatever at its entry. Occasionally Hoffer tried the introduction of a <i>Psithyrus</i> to
  a nest that had not previously had one as an inmate. The new arrival caused a great hubbub among
  the <i>Bombus</i>, which rushed to it as if to attack it, but did not do so, and the alarm soon
  subsided, the <i>Psithyrus</i> taking up the position in the nest usually affected by the
  individuals of the species. On <span class="pagenum" id="page61"><span
  class="smaller">{61}</span></span>introducing a female <i>Psithyrus</i> to a nest of <i>Bombus</i>
  in which a <i>Psithyrus</i> was already present as an established guest, the latter asserted its
  rights and drove away the new comer. Hoffer also tried the experiment of placing a <i>Psithyrus
  campestris</i> in the nest of <i>Bombus lapidarius</i>&mdash;a species to which it was a stranger;
  notwithstanding its haste to fly away, it was at once attacked by the <i>Bombus</i>, who pulled it
  about but did not attempt to sting it.</p>

  <p>When <i>Psithyrus</i> is present in a nest of <i>Bombus</i> it apparently affects the
  inhabitants only by diminishing their stores of food to so great an extent that the colony remains
  small instead of largely increasing in numbers. Although <i>Bombus variabilis</i>, when left to
  itself, increases the number of individuals in a colony to 200 or more, Hoffer found in a nest in
  which <i>Psithyrus</i> was present, that on the 1st of September the assemblage consisted only of
  a queen <i>Bombus</i> and fifteen workers, together with eighteen specimens of the
  <i>Psithyrus</i>, eight of these being females.</p>

  <p>The nests of <i>Bombus</i> are destroyed by several animals, probably for the sake of the honey
  contained in the pots; various kinds of small mammals, such as mice, the weasel, and even the fox,
  are known to destroy them; and quite a fauna of Insects may be found in them; the relations of
  these to their hosts are very little known, but some undoubtedly destroy the bees' larvae, as in
  the case of <i>Meloe</i>, <i>Mutilla</i> and <i>Conops</i>. Birds do not as a rule attack these
  bees, though the bee-eater, <i>Merops apiaster</i>, has been known to feed on them very
  heavily.</p>

  <p>The genera of social bees known as <i>Melipona</i>, <i>Trigona</i> or <i>Tetragona</i>, may,
  according to recent authorities, be all included in one genus, <i>Melipona</i>. Some of these
  Insects are amongst the smallest of bees, so that one, or more, species go by the name of
  "Mosquito-bees." The species appear to be numerous, and occur in most of the tropical parts of the
  continents of the world, but unfortunately very little is known as to their life-histories or
  economics; they are said to form communities consisting at times of a countless number of
  individuals; but it has not been thoroughly ascertained whether these are the produce of a single
  queen, as in the case of the hive-bee, or whether there may be more than one egg-producer in each
  community. The late F. Smith thought the former of these alternatives would prove to be correct.
  These mosquito-bees are frequently spoken of as stingless bees, but this is not quite correct, for
  although they do not sting, <span class="pagenum" id="page62"><span
  class="smaller">{62}</span></span>von Ihering<a id="NtA_34" href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> says
  that all the essential elements of the sting are present, the pointed or penetrating part of the
  apparatus being stunted.</p>

  <p>It would serve no useful purpose to attempt to construct the social history of these stingless
  bees from the numerous brief scattered accounts in entomological literature, for they refer to
  different species; it is, however, positively stated by Smith on the authority of Peckolt<a
  id="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> that <i>Trigona mosquito</i> sends off swarms after

  <p>The nests of many of these little bees are rich in honey, and they have a host of enemies from
  man and monkeys downwards; and as they do not defend themselves by stinging, it might be supposed
  they would have but a poor time of it. From the accounts that have been published we may, however,
  gather that they are rich in devices for the protection of their nests, and for the exclusion of
  intruders. Bates has given some particulars as to <i>Melipona interrupta</i> (<i>fasciculata</i>);
  it is about one-third shorter than the hive-bee, and its colonies are composed of an immense
  number of individuals. The workers are usually occupied in gathering pollen; but they also collect
  clay in a similar manner, and convey it to the nest, where it is used for building a wall to
  complete the fortification of the nest, which is placed either in a suitable bank, or in a trunk
  of a tree; in either situation it is completely built in with clay. A nest which Bates saw opened
  contained about two quarts of pleasantly-tasted liquid honey. Forty-five species of these little
  bees were found in different parts of the Amazons Valley, the largest kind being half an inch in
  length, the smallest very minute, not more than one-twelfth of an inch. These little creatures are
  thus masons as well as workers in wax and resin, and they are also gatherers of nectar, pollen,
  and resin.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page63"><span class="smaller">{63}</span></span></div>

  <p>According to Gosse, one of these bees is well known in Jamaica, where they are called
  "Angelitos," in consequence of their not stinging people. He observed a nest of this bee in a
  tree, and found it to be much infested by black ants anxious to obtain entrance to it; three bees,
  however, stood sentinel in the entrance, so as to completely block it and keep out intruders, but
  the middle bee moved on one side out of the way directly one of its fellows wished to come in or
  out of the nest. The honey accumulated by this species is kept in clusters of cups about the size
  of a pigeon's egg, at the bottom of the hive and away from the brood-cells. The queen or
  mother-bee is lighter in colour than the others, and has the hind body twice the length of
  theirs.</p>

  <p>Hockings<a id="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> has given us some details as to the
  natural history of two of these bees that inhabit Australia, where they are called "Karbi" and
  "Kootchar," the first being, it is supposed, <i>Trigona carbonaria</i>, Smith: it is usually about
  three-sixteenths of an inch in length, the queen, when fully developed, being nearly twice that
  length. The comb is built in a most peculiar form, being, it is said, in the shape of a spiral
  staircase, and tapering towards the ends: honey-pots and pollen are constructed for the storage of
  food. The comb is encased in wax, and outside it a labyrinth of waxen passages is formed. The
  entrance to the colony is guarded by a line of bees who inspect every one that arrives, and it is
  surprising to see how soon a stranger is discovered and pounced upon before it has time even to
  alight; the intruder, when caught, is held by several bees, who put it on the rack by holding and
  stretching out its limbs to their full extent, retaining it in this position for as long as an
  hour, by which time the unfortunate prisoner is usually dead. These bees, as well as many other
  allied species, fight desperately with their mandibles, and are apparently of a very fierce
  disposition. The other species, called "Kootchar," is said to produce a very large number of
  drones, and the habits and dispositions of the bees differ considerably from those of the "Karbi":
  the entrance to their hive is guarded by a pipe of propolis (a sort of resinous wax) about an inch
  in length, having an exceedingly sticky outer edge, and it is by this pipe alone that access to
  the interior can be gained. At night the entrance is closed by numerous minute globules of
  semi-fluid gum placed against it, thus forming a thin wall full of air-holes. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page64"><span class="smaller">{64}</span></span>The colonies of "Kootchar" can
  be united by taking away a queen and then packing her brood-nest, bees and all, against that of
  the colony it is to be joined to. This cannot be done with the "Karbi." The account given by Mr.
  Hockings contains a great many other interesting details, and there can be no doubt that a full
  account of the natural history of these Insects would be very instructive.</p>

  <p>Fritz M&uuml;ller has recorded a singular case bearing on the instinct of these social Insects: he
  says that a nest of a small <i>Trigona</i> was built in a hollow tree, and that as a consequence
  of the irregularity of the hole the bees were obliged to give a very irregular shape to their
  combs of honey. These bees were captured and put in a spacious box (presumably together with the
  irregular comb, but this he unfortunately does not mention): after a year, "when perhaps not a
  single bee survived of those which had come from the canella tree," they still continued to build
  irregular combs, though quite regular combs were built by several other communities of the same
  species that he had kept. These bees, he also tells us, do not use pure wax for the construction
  of their combs, but mix it with resin or gum that gives it a peculiar odour and appearance. He
  captured two communities of a common <i>Melipona</i>, one of which had the combs made of dark
  reddish brown, the other of pale yellowish brown, wax, and in captivity in a distant locality each
  of the two communities continued to form its comb in the same way, thus showing the continuity
  that prevails in these cases as long as circumstances permit. M&uuml;ller thinks this due to imitation,
  but it seems at least as probable that it is due to perception of the properties of the nest. The
  nest has a certain colour that the worker-bee matches.</p>

  <p>Several species of the <i>Melipona</i> and <i>Trigona</i> were imported from Brazil to France,
  and kept there for some time in captivity by M. Drory. Girard has published<a id="NtA_37"
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> some details as to these colonies, and is of opinion that some
  of them indicate an intelligence or instinct superior to that of the honey-bee. The queen-bee of
  <i>M. scutellaris</i> seems to display more intelligence than the corresponding sex of <i>A.
  mellifica</i>. The mode of feeding the larvae apparently differs from that of <i>A. mellifica</i>,
  a provision of pollen being first placed in the cell, then some honey; when <span class="pagenum"
  id="page65"><span class="smaller">{65}</span></span>sufficient food for the whole consumption of a
  larva is accumulated the queen deposits an egg in the cell, which is at once completely closed by
  the worker. The interior of the abode of these bees is quite dark, only a very small orifice being
  left, and in this a sentinel is constantly on the alert. The same writer states that <i>Trigona
  crassipes</i> has the very peculiar habit of always locating its brood-comb in the nest of a
  species of <i>Termes</i>.</p>

  <p>The honey-bee, <i>Apis mellifica</i> (Fig. 6), is considered the highest form attained by the
  Anthophilous division of the Hymenoptera. The differentiation of the three forms, male, female,
  and worker, is here carried to a greater degree of perfection than in the other bees. The drones
  are the males; the individuals we see gathering honey are always workers, neither the male nor the
  female in this species taking any part in procuring food for themselves or for the colony. In
  addition to this the colonies formed may be described as permanent: they do not come to an end at
  the close of one season, and provision is made for the formation of a new colony while the old one
  still persists, by means of a peculiar process called swarming. The life-history of <i>Apis
  mellifica</i> and its anatomy and physiology have been discussed in a whole library of works, and
  we need only notice the chief features. When a swarm of bees leaves a hive it consists of the
  queen-bee or female, and a number of workers, these latter being, in fact, the surplus population
  that has been produced in the hive. The swarm is not a nuptial flight, as is often supposed, but
  an act of emigration. When this swarm has been housed, the bees commence operations in their new
  quarters, by secreting wax; they are enabled to do this by having consumed much saccharine food;
  the wax is produced by means of glands in the hind-body over the inner faces of the ventral plates
  of the abdominal rings, and it makes its appearance there, after passing from the interior of the
  body through some peculiar membranes on the ventral segments, in the form of thin projecting
  plates. These the bee takes off with an apparatus on the hind pair of legs and applies, after
  working up with the mandibles, to form the cells in which young ones are to be reared and food
  stored. A large number of bees working in common thus produce the regular and beautiful structure
  known as the comb; the queen afterwards lays an egg in each cell, and as these soon hatch, great
  labour is thrown on the workers, which have then to feed the young; this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page66"><span class="smaller">{66}</span></span>they do by eating honey and pollen, which,
  being formed into a sort of pap by a portion of their digestive organs, is then regurgitated and
  given to the young, a quantity of it being placed in the cell, so that the larva is bathed by it,
  and possibly may absorb the food by the skin as well as the mouth. When the colony is in good
  progress and young bees emerge, these act as nurses, the older ones cease to prepare food and act
  as foragers, bringing in honey and pollen which are each stored in separate cells. The larva in
  the cell increases its size and sheds a very delicate skin several times; when the larva has
  reached its full size no more food is supplied, but the worker-bees seal up the cell by means of a
  cover formed of pollen and wax, in such a manner as to be pervious to air: sealed up in the cell
  the larva spins a cocoon for itself, remains therein for a little time as a larva, then changes to
  a pupa, and thereafter bites its way out through the cover of the cell, and appears for the first
  time as a new being in the form of a worker-bee; the whole process of development from the
  egg-state to the perfect condition of the worker-bee occupies about three weeks.</p>

  <p>When the denizens of a hive are about to produce another queen, one or more royal cells are
  formed; these are much larger than the ordinary worker-cells, and of a quite different form. In
  this cell is placed an egg, not differing in any respect from the egg that, if placed in an
  ordinary cell, produces a worker; when the egg has produced a larva this is tended with great care
  and fed throughout its life with royal jelly. This food appears to be the same as that supplied to
  an ordinary worker-larva when it is first hatched; but there is this difference, that whereas the
  worker-larva is weaned, and supplied, after the first period of its existence, with food
  consisting largely of honey, pollen and water, the queen-larva is supplied with the pap or royal
  jelly until it is full grown. Some difference of opinion exists as to this royal jelly, some
  thinking that it is a different substance from what the workers are fed with; and it is by no
  means improbable that there may be some difference in the secretion of the glands that furnish a
  part of the material composing the pap. The queen is produced more rapidly than workers are, about
  sixteen days being occupied in the process of her development. Only one queen is allowed in a hive
  at a time; so that when several queen-cells are formed, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page67"><span class="smaller">{67}</span></span>queen-larvae nurtured in them, the first one
  that is developed into a perfect queen goes round and stings the royal nymphs to death while they
  are still in their cells. The production of drones is supposed to depend chiefly on the nature of
  the egg laid by the queen; it being considered that an unfertilised egg is deposited for this
  purpose. There is still some doubt on this point, however. Though there is no doubt that drones
  are produced in great numbers from unfertilised eggs, yet there is not evidence that they cannot
  also be produced from fertilised eggs.<a id="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> The
  drone-cells are somewhat larger than the ordinary worker-cells, but this is probably not of much
  import, and it is said that the larvae intended to produce drones receive a greater proportion of
  pap than worker-larvae do: about twenty-four days are required to produce a drone from the
  egg.</p>

  <p>From this sketch it will be seen that the production of the worker (or third sex, as it is
  improperly called, the workers being really females atrophied in some points and specially
  developed in others) is dependent on the social life, in so far at any rate as the special feeding
  is concerned. There is good reason for supposing that <i>A. mellifica</i> has been kept in a state
  of domestication or captivity for an enormous period of time; and this condition has probably led
  to an increase of its natural peculiarities, or perhaps we should say to a change in them to suit
  a life of confinement. This is certainly the case in regard to swarming, for this process takes
  place with comparative irregularity in <i>Apis mellifica</i> in a wild condition. The killing of
  superfluous queens is also probably a phenomenon of captivity, for it varies even now in
  accordance with the numbers of the colony. It is interesting to notice that in confinement when a
  swarm goes from the hive it is the old queen that accompanies it, and this swarm as a rule settles
  down near the old hive, so that the queen-bee being already fertilised, the new swarm and its
  subsequent increase are nothing but a division of the old hive, the total products of the two
  having but a single father and mother. When a second swarm goes off from a hive it is accompanied
  by a young queen, who frequently, perhaps, in the majority of cases, is unfertilised; this swarm
  is apt to fly for long distances, so that the probability of cross-fertilisation is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page68"><span class="smaller">{68}</span></span>greatly increased, as the
  fertilisation of the young new queen is effected during a solitary flight she makes after the
  colony has settled down. But in a state of nature the colonies do not send off swarms every year
  or once a year, but increase to an enormous extent, going for years without swarming, and then
  when their home is really filled up send off, it may be presumed, a number of swarms in one year.
  Thus the phenomena of bee-life in a wild condition differ considerably from those we see in
  artificial confinement. And this difference is probably greatly accentuated by the action of
  parasites, the proportions of which to their guests are in a state of nature liable to become very
  great; as we have seen to be the case in <i>Bombus</i>.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances it is not a matter for surprise when we find that the honey-bee has
  formed distinct races analogous to those that exist in the case of the domesticated vertebrate
  animals. The knowledge of these races is, however, at present very little advanced, and is
  complicated by the fact that only imperfect information exists as to the true species of the genus
  <i>Apis</i>. There is a bee very like our common honey-bee found in southern Europe called <i>A.
  ligustica</i>; this is certainly a variety of <i>A. mellifica</i>, and the same remark applies to
  a bee found in Egypt, and called <i>A. fasciata</i>. This gives the honey-bee a very wide
  distribution, extending possibly over the whole of the palaearctic region: besides this, the
  species has been introduced into various other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>According to Karsch the honey-bee shows in Germany several varieties, all of which belong to
  the northern form, which may be spoken of as the <i>A. domestica</i> of Ray; the <i>A.
  ligustica</i> and <i>A. fasciata</i> form as we have said distinct races, and it is a remarkable
  fact that these races remain distinct even when imported into other climates; though for how long
  a period of time this remains true there is very little evidence to show. The northern form, <i>A.
  domestica</i>, is now found in very widely separated parts of the world, in some of which it is
  wild; Smith mentions it as occurring in the West India islands, throughout the North American
  continent as far south as Mexico, even in Central and Southern Africa, and in Australia and New
  Zealand. The var. <i>ligustica</i> has been found also at the Cape of Good Hope. The other species
  known of the genus <i>Apis</i> all belong to the Old World, so that there is very little doubt
  that <i>A. mellifica</i> is also <span class="pagenum" id="page69"><span
  class="smaller">{69}</span></span>a true native of the eastern hemisphere, and its original home
  may possibly have been not far from the shores of the eastern portion of the Mediterranean sea.
  Seven or eight other species of <i>Apis</i> are known, all but one of which occur in Asia,
  extending as far as Timor and Celebes. The exceptional one, <i>A. adansonii</i>, occurs in
  tropical Africa and in Madagascar. Gerstaecker thought these species might be reduced to four, but
  Smith's statement that the males and even the workers show good distinctive characters seems to be
  correct. Very little is known as to the honey-bees of China and Japan.</p>

  <p>The queen-bee greatly resembles the worker, but has the hind body more elongated; she can,
  however, always be distinguished from the worker by the absence of the beautiful transverse,
  comb-like series of hairs on the inner side of the first joint of the hind foot, the planta, as it
  is called by the bee-keeper: she has also no wax plates and differs in important anatomical
  peculiarities. The male bee or drone is very different, being of much broader, more robust build,
  and with very large eyes that quite meet in the middle of the upper part of the head: he also has
  the hind leg differently shaped. The form of this limb enables the male of <i>A. mellifica</i> to
  be distinguished from the corresponding sex of allied species of the genus.</p>

  <p>We are indebted to Horne for some particulars as to the habits of <i>A. dorsata</i>, an allied
  East Indian species. He informs us that these bees greatly disfigure buildings, such as the Taj
  Mahal at Agra, by attaching their pendent combs to the marble arches, and are so pertinacious that
  it is almost useless to destroy the nests. This bee is said to be so savage in its disposition
  that it cannot be domesticated; it attacks the sparingly clad Hindoos <span class="pagenum"
  id="page70"><span class="smaller">{70}</span></span>with great ferocity when they disturb its
  nest. Notwithstanding its inclination and power to defend its societies this Insect appears to be
  destroyed wholesale. Colonel Ramsay failed to establish hives of it, because the Insects were
  eaten up by lizards. The crested honey-buzzard carries off large portions of the comb, and devours
  it on a branch of some tree near by, quite regardless of the stings of the bees; while the
  fondness of bears for the honey of the "Dingar," as this species is called, is well known.</p>

  <p>This division of Hymenoptera includes the true wasps, but not the fossorial wasps. The name

  This character is unimportant in function so far as we know,<a id="NtA_40"

  Masaridae do not exhibit it. The character reappears outside the Diploptera in the genus

  Hymenoptera&mdash;the species of which greatly resemble wasps in coloration. A better character is
  that furnished by the well-marked angle, <span class="pagenum" id="page72"><span

  <p>The Eumenidae, or solitary wasps, are very little noticed by the ordinary observer, but they
  are nevertheless more numerous than the social Vespidae, about 800 species being known. In Britain

  exhibit a considerable diversity in form and structure; some of them have the pedicel at the base
  of the abdomen very elongate, while in others this is so short as to be imperceptible in the
  ordinary position of the body. A repetition of similar differences of form occurs in the social
  wasps, so that notwithstanding the difference in habits there seems to be no satisfactory way of
  distinguishing the members of the two families except by the structure of the claws and tibial
  spurs.</p>

  <p>Fabre has sketched the habits of a species of <i>Eumenes</i>, probably <i>E. pomiformis</i>.
  This <i>Eumenes</i> constructs with clay a small vase-like earthenware vessel, in the walls of
  which small stones are embedded (like Fig. 28, B). This it fills with food for the young. The food
  consists of caterpillars to the number of fourteen or sixteen for each nest. These caterpillars
  are believed to be stung by the parent-wasp (as is the case in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page73"><span class="smaller">{73}</span></span>fossorial Hymenoptera), but complete evidence
  of this does not seem to be extant, and if it be so, the stinging does not completely deprive the
  caterpillars of the capacity of movement, for they possess the power of using their mandibles and
  of making strokes, or kicking with the posterior part of the body. It is clear that if the
  delicate egg of the <i>Eumenes</i> or the delicate larva that issues from it were placed in the
  midst of a mass of this kind, it would probably suffer destruction; therefore, to prevent this,
  the egg is not placed among the caterpillars, but is suspended from the dome covering the nest by
  a delicate thread rivalling in fineness the web of the spider, and being above the mass of food it
  is safe. When the young larva leaves the egg it still makes use of the shell as its habitation,
  and eats its first meals from the vantage-point of this suspension; although the mass of the food
  grows less by consumption, the little larva is still enabled to reach it by the fact that the
  egg-shell splits up to a sort of ribbon, and thus adds to the length of the suspensory thread, of
  which it is the terminal portion. Finally the heap of caterpillars shrinks so much that it cannot
  be reached by the larva even with the aid of the augmented length of the suspensory thread; by
  this time, however, the little creature has so much increased in size and strength that it is able
  to take its place amongst the food without danger of being crushed by the mass, and it afterwards
  completes its metamorphosis in the usual manner.</p>

  <p>It is known that other species of <i>Eumenes</i> construct vase-like nests; <i>E.
  unguiculata</i>, however, according to an imperfect account given by Perris, makes with earth a
  closed nest of irregular shape, containing three cells in one mass. The saliva of these builders
  has the power of acting as a cement, and of forming with the clay a very impenetrable material.
  One species, <i>E. coarctata</i>, L. of this genus occurs in Britain. The clay <span
  class="pagenum" id="page74"><span class="smaller">{74}</span></span>nests (Fig. 29) of this Insect
  are often attached to the twigs of shrubs, while those of the two species previously mentioned are
  usually placed on objects that offer a large surface for fixing the foundations to, such as walls.
  According to Goureau the larva of this species forms in one corner of its little abode, separated
  by a partition, a sort of dust-heap in which it accumulates the various d&eacute;bris resulting from the
  consumption of its stores.</p>

  <p><i>Eumenes conica</i>, according to Horne, constructs in Hindostan clay-nests with very
  delicate walls. This species provisions its nest with ten or twelve green caterpillars; on one
  occasion this observer took from one cell eight green caterpillars and one black. It is much
  attacked by parasites owing, it is thought, to the delicacy of the walls of the cells, which are
  easily pierced; from one group of five cells two specimens only of the <i>Eumenes</i> were
  reared.</p>

  <p><i>Odynerus</i>, with numerous sub-genera, the names of which are often used as those of
  distinct genera, includes the larger part of the solitary wasps; it is very widely distributed
  over the earth, and is represented by many peculiar species even in the isolated Archipelago of
  Hawaii; in Britain we have about fifteen species of the genus. The <i>Odynerus</i> are less
  accomplished architects than the species of <i>Eumenes</i>, and usually play the more humble parts
  of adapters and repairers; they live either in holes in walls, or in posts or other woodwork, or
  in burrows in the earth, or in stems of plants. Several species of the sub-genus <i>Hoplopus</i>
  have the remarkable habit of constructing burrows in sandy ground, and forming at their entry a
  curvate, freely projecting tube placed at right angles to the main burrow, and formed of the
  grains of sand brought out by the Insect during excavation and cemented together. The habits of
  one such species were described by R&eacute;aumur, of another by Dufour; and recently Fabre has added to
  the accounts of these naturalists some important information drawn from his own observations on
  <i>O. reniformis</i>.</p>

  <p>This Insect provisions its cell with small caterpillars to the number of twenty or upwards
  (Fig. 28, A.) The egg is deposited before the nest is stocked with food; it is suspended in such a
  manner that the suspensory thread allows the egg to reach well down towards the bottom of the
  cell. The caterpillars placed as food in the nest are all curled up, each forming a ring
  approximately adapted to the calibre of the cell. Fabre believes these caterpillars to be partly
  stupefied by stinging, but the act has not been observed either by himself, R&eacute;aumur, or Dufour.
  The first caterpillar is eaten by the wasp-larva from its point of suspension; after this first
  meal has been made the larva is supposed to undergo a change of skin; it then abandons the
  assistance of the suspensory thread, taking up a position in the vacant chamber at the end of the
  cell and drawing the caterpillars to itself one by one. This arrangement permits the caterpillars
  to be consumed in the order in which they were placed in the cell, so that the one that is weakest
  on account of its longer period of starvation is first devoured. Fabre thinks all the above points
  are essential to the successful development of this wasp-larva, the suspension protecting the egg
  and the young larva from destruction by pressure or movement of the caterpillars, while the
  position of the larva when it leaves the thread and takes its place on the floor of the cell
  ensures its consuming the food in the order of introduction; besides this the caterpillars used
  are of a proper size and of a species the <span class="pagenum" id="page76"><span
  class="smaller">{76}</span></span>individuals of which have the habit of rolling themselves up in
  a ring; while, as the calibre of the tube is but small, they are unable to straighten themselves
  and move about, so that their consumption in proper order is assured. Some interesting points in
  the habits of an allied species, <i>O.</i> (<i>Pterocheilus</i>) <i>spinipes</i> have been
  observed by Verhoeff; the facts as regards the construction and provisioning of the cell are
  almost the same as in <i>O. reniformis</i>. The species of <i>Odynerus</i> are very subject to the
  attacks of parasites, and are, it is well known, destroyed to an enormous extent by Chrysididae.
  Verhoeff says that the wasp in question supplied food much infested by entoparasites; further,
  that a fly, <i>Argyromoeba sinuata</i>, takes advantage of the habit of the <i>Odynerus</i> of
  leaving its nest open during the process of provisioning, and deposits also an egg in the nest;
  the <i>Odynerus</i> seems, however, to have no power of discovering the fact, or more probably has
  no knowledge of its meaning, and so concludes the work of closing the cell in the usual way; the
  egg of the <i>Argyromoeba</i> hatches, and the maggot produced feeds on the caterpillars the wasp
  intended for its own offspring. Verhoeff observed that the egg of the wasp-larva is destroyed, but
  he does not know whether this was done by the mother <i>Argyromoeba</i> or by the larva hatched
  from her egg. Fabre's observations on allied species of Diptera render it, however, highly
  probable that the destruction is effected by the young fly-larva and not by the mother-fly.</p>

  <p>Mr. R. C. L. Perkins once observed several individuals of our British <i>O. callosus</i>
  forming their nests in a clay bank, and provisioning them with larvae, nearly all of which were
  parasitised, and that to such an extent as to be evident both to the eye and the touch. In a few
  days after the wasps' eggs were laid, swarms of the minute parasites emerged and left no food for
  the <i>Odynerus</i>. Curiously, as it would seem, certain of the parasitised and stored-up larvae
  attempted (as parasitised larvae not infrequently do), to pupate. From which, as Mr. Perkins
  remarks, we may infer that (owing to distortion) the act of paralysing by the wasp had been
  ineffectual. Mr. Perkins has also observed that some of the numerous species of Hawaiian
  <i>Odynerus</i> make a single mud-cell, very like the pot of an <i>Eumenes</i>, but cylindrical
  instead of spherical. This little vessel is often placed in a leaf that a spider curls up; young
  molluscs of the genus <i>Achatinella</i> also <span class="pagenum" id="page77"><span
  class="smaller">{77}</span></span>avail themselves of this shelter, so that a curious colony is
  formed, consisting of the <i>Odynerus</i> in its pot, of masses of the young spiders, and of the
  little molluscs.</p>

  <p>Horne has recorded that the East Indian <i>O. punctum</i> is fond of availing itself of holes
  in door-posts where large screws have been; after the hole has been filled with provisions, the
  orifice is covered over level with the surface of the wood so that it eludes human observation. It
  is nevertheless discovered by an Ichneumon-fly which pierces the covering with its ovipositor and
  deposits an egg within.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Abispa</i> is peculiar to Australia and includes some very fine solitary wasps,
  having somewhat the appearance of very large <i>Odynerus</i>: these Insects construct a beautiful
  nest with a projecting funnel-shaped entrance, and of so large a size that it might pass for the
  habitation of a colony of social wasps; it appears, however, that this large nest is really formed
  by a single female.</p>

  <p>The species of the genus <i>Rhygchium</i> are also of insecticide habits, and appear to prefer
  the stems of pithy plants as the nidus for the development of the generation that is to follow
  them. Lichtenstein says that a female of the European <i>R. oculatum</i> forms fifteen to twenty
  cells in such a situation, and destroys 150 to 200 caterpillars, and he suggests that, as it is
  easy to encourage these wasps to nest in a suitable spot, we should utilise them to free our
  gardens from caterpillars, as we do cats to clear the mice from our apartments.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The East Indian <i>R. carnaticum</i> seems to have very similar habits to its
  European congener, adapting for its use the hollow stems of bamboos. Horne has recorded a case in
  which a female of this species took possession of a stem in which a bee, <i>Megachile lanata</i>,
  had already constructed two cells; it first formed a partition of mud over the spot occupied by
  the bee, this partition being similar to that which it makes use of for separating the spaces
  intended for its own young. This species stores caterpillars for the benefit of its larvae, and
  this is also the case with another Eastern species, <i>R. nitidulum</i>. This latter Insect,
  however, does not nidificate in the stems of plants, but constructs clay cells similar to those of
  <i>Eumenes</i>, and fixes them firmly to wood. <i>Rhygchium brunneum</i> is said by Sir Richard
  Owen to obliterate hieroglyphic inscriptions in Egypt by its habit of building mud <span
  class="pagenum" id="page78"><span class="smaller">{78}</span></span>nests amongst them. An
  individual of this wasp was found by Dr. Birch when unrolling a mummy&mdash;"There being every
  reason to believe that the Insect had remained in the position in which it was found ever since
  the last rites were paid to the ancient Egyptian."</p>

  <p>The anterior wing possesses four submarginal cells, as in the Eumenidae. The attention of
  entomologists has been more directed to the habits and architecture than to the taxonomy of these
  Insects, so that the external structure of the Insects themselves has not been so minutely or
  extensively scrutinised as is desirable; de Saussure, the most important authority, bases his
  classification of the Insects themselves on the nature of the nests they form. These habitations
  consist of an envelope, protecting cells similar in form to the comb of the honey-bee, but there
  is this important difference between the two, that while the bee forms its comb of wax that it
  secretes, the wasps make use of paper or card that they form from fragments of vegetable
  tissue,&mdash;more particularly woody fibre&mdash;amalgamated by means of cement secreted by
  glands; the vegetable fragments are obtained by means of the mandibles, the front legs playing a

  fossorial Hymenoptera.</p>

  <p>In most of the nests of Vespid&aelig; the comb is placed in stages or stories one above the other,
  and separated by an intervening space, but in many cases there is only one mass of comb. It is the
  rule that, when the cells of the comb are only partially formed, eggs are deposited in them, and
  that the larva resulting from the egg is fed and tended by the mother, or by her assistants, the
  workers; as the larvae grow, the cells are increased in correspondence with the size of the larva;
  the subsequent metamorphosis to pupa and imago taking place in the cells after they have been
  entirely <span class="pagenum" id="page79"><span class="smaller">{79}</span></span>closed. The

  <p>Although the nests of the social wasps are very elaborate constructions, yet they serve the
  purposes of the Insects for only a single season. This is certainly the case in our own country.
  Here each nest is commenced by a single female or queen; she at first performs unaided all the
  duties for the inauguration of the colony; she lays the foundation of the cells, deposits the eggs
  in them, feeds the young, and thus rears a brood of workers that at once assist her, and for the
  future relieve her of a considerable portion of her former occupations; the nest is by them added
  to and increased, till the cold weather of the autumn is at hand; at this time many males and
  females are produced; the cold weather either destroys the inhabitants of the nest, or reduces
  their vitality so that it is impossible for them to pursue successfully the avocations necessary
  for their subsistence, and <span class="pagenum" id="page80"><span
  class="smaller">{80}</span></span>they succumb to adversity. The young females, however,
  hibernate, and each one that lives through the winter is the potential founder of a new nest in
  the way we have already described. It might be supposed that in tropical countries where no cold
  season occurs the phenomena would be different, that the colonies would be permanent, and that the
  nests would be inhabited until they were worn out. De Saussure, however, informs us that this is
  not the case, but that in the tropics also the colonies die off annually. "The nests are
  abandoned," he says, "without it being possible to discover the reason, for apparently neither
  diminution of temperature nor scarcity of food cause them (the Insects) to suffer. One is tempted
  to suppose that the death of the Insects is the result of a physiological necessity."</p>

  <p><b>Nests of Social Wasps.</b>&mdash;In Europe wasps' nests disappear very soon after they are
  deserted. As it would appear from de Saussure's conclusions that in the tropics as well as in the
  temperate regions the rule is that the colonies endure only a portion of one year, and that a new
  nest is commenced by a single founder once in twelve months, it is a somewhat remarkable fact that
  some tropical wasp-nests are much more durable than the lives of the inhabitants require, so that
  solidly constructed nests are often found hanging to the trees long after they have been deserted,
  and are sometimes overgrown with moss. Cuming has recorded the fact that he found in South America
  an old wasp-nest that had been taken possession of by swallows. We do not assign, however, much
  importance to the views of de Saussure, because we may anticipate that enquiry will reveal much
  variety in the habits of tropical and sub-tropical wasps. It is known that species exist that
  store up honey, after the fashion of bees, and von Ihering has recently shown<a id="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> that in Brazil, species of several genera form new colonies by
  swarming, after the manner of bees. So that it is possible that certain colonies may remain for a
  long period in the same nest.</p>

  <p>Much more variety exists in wasps' nests than would be supposed probable; those formed by some
  of the tropical species of Vespidae are enveloped in so solid and beautifully constructed an
  envelope of papier-mach&eacute;, that they resist with complete success the torrential rains of the
  tropics; while some of those found in our own country are made of extremely soft and delicate
  paper, <span class="pagenum" id="page81"><span class="smaller">{81}</span></span>which is probably
  chiefly glandular products. Our British Vespidae number only eight species, all belonging to the
  one genus Vespa, and yet they exhibit three different modes of nidification. <i>Vespa
  vulgaris</i>, <i>V. germanica</i> and <i>V. rufa</i> form subterranean nests, while <i>V.
  arborea</i>, <i>V. sylvestris</i> and <i>V. norvegica</i> suspend their habitations from the
  branches of trees, bushes, or strong annual plants. <i>Vespa crabro</i>, the hornet, usually
  adopts an intermediate course, forming its nest above ground, but in a spot where it is protected
  and concealed. The favourite habitat of this formidable Insect is the interior of an old tree, but
  the hornet will sometimes avail itself of the protection of a thatched roof. Both it and other
  arboreal species are said, however, to occasionally make subterranean nests. It is ascertained
  that <i>V. austriaca</i>, the eighth species, is an inquiline.</p>

  </div>

  <p>De Saussure,<a id="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> the monographer of the social
  wasps, classifies them according to the architecture of their nests. He establishes three groups:
  (1) Stelocyttares, in which the layers of comb are not connected with the envelope, but are
  supported by pillars made by the wasps (Fig. 31); (2) Poecilocyttares, an unsatisfactory group of
  which the chief characteristics appear to be that the nest is always covered by an envelope, and
  the comb is supported by an object such as the branch of a tree, round, or on, which the envelope
  is placed (Fig. 32); (3) Phragmocyttares, in which the layers of comb are supported, in part or
  entirely, by the envelope of the nest, communication being effected by a hole in each layer of the
  comb (Fig. 33). de Saussure's classification is far from satisfactory. There are many social wasps
  that construct nests destitute of any proper envelope; as an example of this, we may mention the
  species of <span class="pagenum" id="page82"><span class="smaller">{82}</span></span>the abundant
  genus <i>Polistes</i>; these Insects make hexagonal cells, of paper-like material, forming an
  irregular comb, or mass, attached to bushes by a stalk near its centre; these nests are placed so
  that the mouths of the open cells look downwards. The species of <i>Ischnogaster</i> (Fig. 34)
  make layers of comb, connected by a pedicel, but without any envelope; these Insects form a
  section of Stelocyttares called Gymnodomes.</p>

  <p>Most of the nests of the Poecilocyttares have only a single layer of comb. The wasps of the
  genera <i>Synoeca</i> and <i>Polybia</i> have the habit of spreading a layer of cells on a leaf,
  or on the bark of a tree, and of covering this with an envelope that is pierced by a single
  orifice only, but that does not rest on the cells, and so allows circulation of the Insects
  between the cells and the envelope. This appears to be the arrangement in a nest of <i>Synoeca
  cyanea</i> preserved in the British Museum; in this construction a large layer of cells is moulded
  on the branch of a tree, whose contour, for a length of two or three feet, it consequently
  follows; while outside the mass there is placed a continuous envelope, leaving a considerable
  distance between it and the cells.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible in the space at our disposal to give a satisfactory account of all the
  forms of wasp-nests, and we must therefore refer the student to de Saussure's work, confining
  ourselves to a brief notice of some specially interesting forms. The habitation of the Brazilian
  <i>Polybia</i> (<i>Myrapetra</i>) <i>scutellaris</i> is a very solid, closed structure, covered
  externally with rough knobs or angular projections. Although of very large size&mdash;it may be
  upwards of two feet in length&mdash;it is suspended from a branch, and has but one orifice; the
  arrangement of the combs in the interior is that of the Phragmocyttares, they being firmly
  attached to the outer envelope, and so placed as to form a curved surface, the convexity of which
  is downwards: the number of wasps in a well-developed nest of this kind must be very great. This
  species is said to be a honey-gathering wasp.</p>

  <p>One of the best known of the South American wasps' nests is the construction (Fig. 33) of
  <i>Chartergus chartarius</i>; these nests are so regularly shaped, and formed of papier-mach&eacute; so
  compact and solid, as to look like stone: this edifice is attached in a very firm manner to the
  branch of a tree, and has a single portal of entry beneath; its interior arrangement is much like
  that of <i>Myrapetra scutellaris</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page83"><span class="smaller">{83}</span></span></div>

  <p>A very remarkable wasp's nest is preserved in the British Museum of Natural History; it is
  considered to be the work of <i>Montezumia dimidiata</i> Sauss. an Eumenid wasp; it is a large
  mass of cells encircling the branch of a tree, which therefore projects somewhat after the manner
  of an axle through the middle: the cells are very numerous, and are quite as regular as those of
  the most perfect of the combs of bees: the mass is covered with a very thick layer of paper, the
  nest having somewhat the external appearance of half a cocoa-nut of twice the usual size.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Apoica pallida</i>, a South American Insect, forms a nest in a somewhat similar manner to
  <i>Polistes</i>, but it is covered on its outer aspect by a beautiful paper skin, so that the nest
  looks somewhat like a toadstool of large size attached to the branch of a tree.</p>

  <p>The nests of the Insects of the genus <i>Polybia</i>&mdash;which we have already mentioned as
  located by de Saussure in his unsatisfactory group Poecilocyttares&mdash;usually have somewhat the
  form and size of pears or apples suspended to twigs of trees or bushes; these little habitations
  consist of masses of cells, wrapped in wasp-paper, in which there are one or more orifices for
  ingress and egress. Smith says that the combs in the nest of <i>P. pygmaea</i> are of the most
  exquisite construction, and that it is by no means an uncommon circumstance to find the outer
  envelope of the nest ornamented with patches of delicate hexagonal tracery. This nest is about the
  size of an orange.</p>

  <p>We have already noticed the variety of nests formed by our British species of the genus
  <i>Vespa</i>; in other parts of the world the edifices formed by species of <i>Vespa</i> attain a
  very large size. <i>V. crabroniformis</i> in China, and <i>V. velutina</i> in India, make nests
  several feet or even yards in length, inhabited by an enormous number of individuals; they are
  apparently constructed of a material like brittle paper, and are arranged much like the nests of
  our British hornet, <i>V. crabro</i>. <i>Vespa orientalis</i> mixes a considerable quantity of
  earth with the paper it uses for its <span class="pagenum" id="page84"><span
  class="smaller">{84}</span></span>constructive efforts. In the British Museum collection there is
  a nest said to be that of the Japanese hornet, <i>V. japonica</i>. This is completely covered by a
  paper envelope, and has apparently only a single small orifice for ingress and egress. In the same
  collection there is a nest from Bahia (believed to be that of a social wasp, though of what
  species is unknown), the outer wall of which is apparently formed entirely of earth, and is a
  quarter or half an inch thick: the comb inside appears also to be formed of clay, the whole
  forming an elaborate construction in pottery. One is tempted to believe it may prove to be the
  production of a social Eumenid.</p>

  <p><b>Habits of Social Wasps.</b>&mdash;We have already briefly noticed the way in which a colony
  of wasps is founded, but some further particulars as to the mode in which the society is increased
  and developed may be mentioned. The queen-wasp makes at first only a very small group of three or
  four incomplete cells; each cell is at first circular, or nearly so, and moreover is of smaller
  diameter than it will afterwards be. In each of the first three or four incomplete cells an egg is
  laid, and more cells are commenced; but as the eggs soon hatch and produce larvae that grow
  rapidly, the labours of the queen-wasp are chiefly directed to feeding the young. At first she
  supplies them with saccharine matter, which she procures from flowers or fruits, but soon gives
  them a stronger diet of insect meat. This is procured by chasing living Insects of various kinds.
  Some species of wasps prefer particular kinds of Insects, and the hornet is said to be very fond
  of the honey-bee, but as a rule Diptera are the prey selected. When an Insect has been secured,
  the hard and innutritious parts are bitten off, and the succulent parts, more especially the
  thorax which contains chiefly muscular tissue, are reduced to a pulp by means of the mandibles;
  this is offered to the larvae, which are said to stretch out their heads to the mother to receive
  the food, after the manner of nestling birds. When a larva is full grown it spins a cocoon in the
  cell and changes to a pupa. It is said by some entomologists that the queen-wasp closes the cell
  for the purpose of the larval metamorphosis; but this is contradicted by others, and is probably
  erroneous. In about a month, or a little less, from the time of deposition of the egg, the perfect
  Insect is ready for issue, and almost immediately after leaving its cell it assists in the work
  that is going on for the development of the society. The <span class="pagenum" id="page85"><span
  class="smaller">{85}</span></span>Insects produced at this early period of the colony are
  exclusively workers, <i>i.e.</i> imperfect females. They relieve the queen of the task of
  supplying the larvae with food, and she henceforth remains within the nest, being, it is said,
  herself fed by her workers; the society now rapidly increases in numbers, and fresh combs are
  formed, the upper layer being always the oldest. About the month of August, cells of larger size
  than those that have previously been constructed are formed, and in these males and perfect
  females are produced; in a few weeks after this the colony languishes and becomes extinct. When it
  is no longer possible for the enfeebled wasps to carry out their tasks of feeding the brood, they
  drag the larvae out of the cells and destroy them. An uncertain number of queen-wasps seek
  protected nooks in which to pass the winter, and each of these queens may be the founder of a nest
  in the ensuing spring. It should be remarked that de Saussure states that all the intermediate
  grades between perfect and imperfect females exist, and Marchal's recent observations confirm
  this. There is in fact no line of demarcation between worker and queen in the wasps as there is in
  the honey-bee. Von Siebold long since drew attention to the existence of parthenogenesis in
  certain species of wasps, and it appears probable that it is of common occurrence.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the social life of European wasps has recently been much increased by the
  observations of two French naturalists, P. Marchal and C. Janet. The latter has given an elaborate
  history of a nest of the hornet, showing the rate and variations of increase in numbers. His
  observations on this and other species indicate that warmth is of the utmost importance to wasps;
  the Insects themselves create a considerable amount of heat, so that the temperature of their
  abodes is much greater than that of the air. He considers that in Europe an elevated temperature
  is essential for the development of the individual,<a id="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and that the chief object of the various wrappers of paper with
  which the Insects surround their nests is to keep up this high temperature. These envelopes give a
  great deal of trouble to the Insects, for they have to be repeatedly <span class="pagenum"
  id="page86"><span class="smaller">{86}</span></span>destroyed and reformed, as the combs they
  contain increase in size. Marchal's observations<a id="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
  relate chiefly to the production of the sexes and worker-forms, in the subterranean species,
  <i>Vespa germanica</i> and <i>V. vulgaris</i>. The layers of comb include cells of two sizes. The
  upper layers, which are the first formed, consist of small cells only: the lower combs are
  constructed (at Paris) early in August, and consist of larger cells from which males and large
  females are reared. The males are, however, reared also in large numbers in the small cells. If
  the queen be removed, the workers become fertile, and produce parthenogenetically many eggs, but
  all of the male sex. He entertains no doubt that even when the queen is in full vigour the workers
  produce males if there is an abundant food supply.</p>

  <p>The social wasps at present known number 500 or 600 species. <i>Polistes</i> is a very
  extensive genus, and it has also a very wide geographical distribution; some of the
  species&mdash;and those found in widely-distant parts of the world&mdash;are remarkable on account
  of their excessive variation in colour, and it is worthy of note that the extreme forms have been
  more than once taken from the same nest.</p>

  <p>Next to <i>Polistes</i>, <i>Vespa</i> is the most numerous in species, about 150 being known,
  and it is to this genus that all our British social wasps belong. No Insects are better known in
  our islands than these wasps, owing to the great numbers of individuals that occur in certain
  seasons, as well as to their frequently entering our habitations and partaking of our food, and to
  the terror that is occasioned by their supposed ferocity and desire to sting. This last feature is
  a complete mistake; wasps never sting unless they are roused to do so by attacks, or by
  considerable interference with their work. The only real danger arises from the fact that a wasp
  may be occasionally taken into the mouth with fruit, or may be handled unawares. When they are
  flying about they are perfectly harmless unless attacked or irritated, and even if they settle on
  the person no danger of their stinging exists unless movement is made. Sichel correctly states
  that a person may station himself close to a wasp's nest and remain there without any risk at all,
  provided that he makes no movement; indeed, it is more than probable that if no movement, or if
  only gentle <span class="pagenum" id="page87"><span class="smaller">{87}</span></span>movement, be
  made, the wasps are unaware of the presence of an intruder. It is, however, well ascertained that
  if they are molested at their work, more especially when they are actually engaged in the duties
  of the nest, they are then extremely vindictive, and follow for a considerable distance those who
  have irritated them. The East Indian <i>V. velutina</i> is specially fierce when aroused, and is
  said by Horne to have followed a party through dense jungle for miles, and on some occasions to
  have stung animals, and even human beings, to death.</p>

  <p>This vindictiveness is, however, only an exceptional mood due to some interference with the
  colony. Even the hornet, notwithstanding its threatening appearance, is harmless unless unduly
  provoked; its nests and their inhabitants can be kept in domesticity, exhibited to strangers, even
  moved from place to place, yet the hornets will not take offence if due gentleness be observed. It
  is said that wasps will rear the progeny of a neighbour in circumstances where this assistance is
  necessary. Hess has related a case in which a queen-hornet had commenced a nest, and was killed by
  an accident, leaving young brood in the comb <span class="pagenum" id="page88"><span
  class="smaller">{88}</span></span>unprovided for: as a result many of the helpless grubs died, and
  others were in a state of starvation, when a strange queen-hornet appeared, associated itself with
  the comb, and, adopting the orphan brood, nourished them and brought them to their full size.</p>

  <p>We have already alluded to the fact that, so far as external structure is concerned, there is
  no great difference between the social and the solitary wasps. Both, too, run through analogous
  series of forms and colours, and the genus <i>Ischnogaster</i> (Fig. 34) seems to connect the two
  groups by both its structure and mode of life. The social habits are in many species only
  inferred, and with greater knowledge will probably prove fallacious as a guide to classification;
  indeed we have already said that in the genus <i>Vespa</i>&mdash;perhaps the most perfectly social
  of all the wasps&mdash;there is one species that has no worker, and that lives, it is supposed, as
  a parasite, in the nests of its congeners. For this species, <i>V. austriaca</i>, it has been
  proposed to create a separate genus, <i>Pseudovespa</i>, on account of this peculiarity of habit,
  although no structural character has been detected that could distinguish it. De Saussure has
  stated his conviction that workers do not exist in some of the exotic genera, so that it appears
  highly probable that with the progress of knowledge the present division between social and
  solitary wasps will prove untenable.</p>

  <p>Remains of Insects referred to the genera <i>Polistes</i> and <i>Vespa</i> have been found in
  tertiary strata in various parts of Europe and in North America.</p>

  Insects of the greatest rarity. In their appearance the Insects of this Family differ considerably
  from the other Diploptera, and as the wings are only imperfectly, or not at all, plicate, it must
  be admitted that the systematic affinities of the group require reconsideration. The pronotal
  structure is, however, completely that of Diploptera. The typical form of the Family, <i>Masaris
  vespiformis</i>, though described a hundred years since, is a species of such extreme rarity, and
  its sexes are so different, that entomologists have only recently been able to agree about it. It
  has been found in Egypt and Algeria. The genera <i>Ceramius</i>, <i>Jugurthia</i>,
  <i>Quartenia</i> and <i>Coelonites</i> are also members of the Mediterranean fauna, while
  <i>Paragia</i> is Australian, and <i>Trimeria</i> South American. Several species of the genus
  <i>Masaris</i> inhabit North America, and Cresson has recently described another Masarid genus
  from the same country, under the name of <i>Euparagia</i>.</p>

  <p>The little that is known of their natural history is almost limited to an account given by
  Giraud of the habits of <i>Ceramius lusitanicus</i>, of which species he found a colony near
  Brian&ccedil;on. The Insect makes nests in the earth; they are entered by means of a chimney-like passage
  analogous to what is formed by certain <i>Odynerus</i>; the gallery when completed is about six
  centimetres long, and at its extremity is an earthen cell in which the larva lives; this is fed by
  the mother, who brings to it from time to time a supply of a paste, described as being somewhat
  like dried honey. The growth of the larva is believed to be rapid.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Fossorial Hymenoptera are distinguished from other Aculeates at present only by negative
  characters, <i>i.e.</i> they are Aculeates, but are not ants, bees or wasps. According to their
  habits they fall into four, by no means sharply distinguished, groups&mdash;(1) those that form no
  special receptacles for their young, but are either of parasitic or sub-parasitic habits, or take
  advantage of the abodes of other Insects, holes, etc.; (2) constructors of cells of clay formed
  into pottery by the saliva of the Insect, and by drying; (3) excavators of burrows in the ground;
  (4) makers of tunnels in wood or stems of plants. Several species make use of both of the last two
  methods. The habits are carnivorous; the structures formed are not for the benefit of the makers,
  but are constructed and stored with food for the next generation. Their remarkable habits
  attracted some attention even 2000 years or more ago, and were to some extent observed by
  Aristotle. The great variety in the habits of the species, the extreme industry, skill, and
  self-denial they display in carrying out their voluntary labours, render them one of the most
  instructive groups of the animal kingdom. There are no social or gregarious <span class="pagenum"
  id="page91"><span class="smaller">{91}</span></span>forms, they are true individualists, and their
  lives and instincts offer many subjects for reflection. Unlike the social Insects they can learn
  nothing whatever from either example or precept. The skill of each individual is prompted by no
  imitation. The life is short, the later stages of the individual life are totally different from
  the earlier: the individuals of one generation only in rare cases see even the commencement of the
  life of the next; the progeny, for the benefit of which they labour with unsurpassable skill and
  industry, being unknown to them. Were such a solicitude displayed by ourselves we should connect
  it with a high sense of duty, and poets and moralists would vie in its laudation. But having
  dubbed ourselves the higher animals, we ascribe the eagerness of the solitary wasp to impulse or
  instinct, and we exterminate their numerous species from the face of the earth for ever, without
  even seeking to make a prior acquaintance with them. Meanwhile our economists and moralists devote
  their volumes to admiration of the progress of the civilisation that effects this destruction and
  tolerates this negligence.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that in the solitary as in the social Insects the males take no part
  whatever in these industrial occupations, and apparently are even unaware of them. It is
  remarkable that, notwithstanding this, the sexual differences are in the majority less than is
  usual in Insects. It is true that the various forms of Scoliidae exhibit sexual distinctions
  which, in the case of Thynnides and Mutillides are carried to an extreme degree, but these are
  precisely the forms in which skill and ingenuity are comparatively absent, the habits being rather
  of the parasitic than of the industrial kind, while the structure is what is usually called
  degraded (<i>i.e.</i> wingless). The great difference between the habits of the sexes, coupled
  with the fact that there is little or no difference in their appearance, has given rise to a
  curious Chinese tradition with regard to these Insects, dating back to Confucius at least.<a
  id="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> The habit of stinging and storing caterpillars in a
  cell, from which a fly similar to itself afterwards proceeds having been noticed, it was supposed
  to be the male that performed these operations; and that when burying the caterpillars he
  addressed to them a spell, the burden of which is "mimic me." In obedience the caterpillars
  produce the wasp, which is called to this day "Jiga," that is in English "mimic me." The idea was
  probably to the effect that the male, not being able to produce eggs, used charmed caterpillars to
  continue the species.</p>

  <p>Great diversity of opinion exists as to the classification of the Fossores. This arises chiefly
  from the incomplete state of the collections studied, and from the fact that the larger part of
  the works published are limited to local faunae. Opinions as to the families vary; some admitting
  only three or four, others upwards of twenty. After consideration of the various views, the writer
  thinks it best to admit at present only three families, which speaking broadly, correspond with
  habits, viz. (1) Scoliidae, subterranean stingers; (2) Pompilidae, runners; (3) Sphegidae,
  stingers above ground.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">We shall treat as sub-families those divisions of Scoliidae and Sphegidae
  considered by many as families.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page94"><span class="smaller">{94}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. 1. Scoliidae.</b></p>

  <p>The members of this family, so far as is known, display less perfect instincts than the
  Sphegidae and Pompilidae, and do not construct cells or form burrows. Information as to the habits
  is almost confined to European forms. We adopt five sub-families.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Mutillides.</b>&mdash;<i>The sides of the pronotum reach the
    tegulae: the female is destitute of wings and ocelli, frequently having the parts of the thorax
    so closely soldered that the divisions between them are obliterated: the males are winged,
    furnished with ocelli, and having the thoracic divisions distinct; intermediate tibiae with two
    apical spurs. Front wing with two or three sub-marginal cells. The larvae live parasitically at
    the expense of other Hymenoptera Aculeata.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Mutillides have some resemblance to ants, though, as they are usually covered with hair,
  and there is never any node at the base of the abdomen, they are readily distinguished from the
  Formicidae. The great difference between the sexes is their most striking character. Their system
  of coloration is often very remarkable, the velvet-like pubescence clothing their bodies being
  variegated with patches of sharply contrasted vivid colour; in other cases the contrast of colour
  is due to bare, ivory-like spaces. They have the faculty of stridulating, the position and nature
  of the organ for the purpose being the same as in ants.</p>

  <p>Very little exact information exists as to the habits and life-histories of the species. Christ
  and Drewsen, forty or fifty years ago, recorded that <i>M. europaea</i> lives in the nests of bees
  of the genus <i>Bombus</i>, and Hoffer has since made some observations on the natural history of
  the same species in South East Europe, where this <i>Mutilla</i> is found in the nests of ten or
  eleven species of <i>Bombus</i>, being most abundant in those of <i>B. agrorum</i> and <i>B.
  variabilis</i>; occasionally more individuals of <i>Mutilla</i> than of bees may be found in a
  nest. He supposes that the egg of the <i>Mutilla</i> is placed in the young larva of the
  <i>Bombus</i>, and hatches in about three days; the larva feeds inside the bee-larva, and when
  growth is completed a cocoon is spun in the interior of the pupa-case of the bee. When the perfect
  Insects emerge, the males leave the nest very speedily, but the females remain for some time
  feeding on the bees' honey. Females are usually produced in greater numbers than males. This
  account leaves <span class="pagenum" id="page95"><span class="smaller">{95}</span></span>much to
  be desired. From the observations of Radoszkowsky it is clear that other species of Mutillides are
  by no means confined to the nests of <i>Bombus</i> but live at the expense of Aculeate Hymenoptera
  of various groups. This naturalist asserts that the basal abdominal segment of the parasite
  resembles in form that of the species on which it preys.</p>

  <p>The apterous condition of the females of Mutillides and Thynnides is very anomalous in the
  Fossors; this sex being in the other families distinguished for activity and intelligence. The
  difference between the sexes is also highly remarkable. The males differ from the females by the
  possession of wings and by the structural characters we have mentioned, and also in a most
  striking manner in both colour and form; Burmeister, indeed, says that in South America&mdash;the
  metropolis of Mutillides&mdash;there is not a single species in which the males and females are
  alike in appearance; this difference becomes in some cases so extreme that the two sexes of one
  species have been described as Insects of different families.</p>

  <p>Upwards of one thousand species are assigned to the genus <i>Mutilla</i>, which is distributed
  over the larger part of the world; there is so much difference in these species as to the
  nervuration of the wings in the males, that several genera would be formed for them were it not
  that no corresponding distinctions can be detected in the females. Three or four species of
  <i>Mutilla</i> are described as being apterous in the male as well as in the female sex; they are
  very rare, and little is known about them. Only three species of Mutillides occur in Britain, and
  they are but rarely seen, except by those who are acquainted with their <span class="pagenum"
  id="page96"><span class="smaller">{96}</span></span>habits. The African and East Indian genus,
  <i>Apterogyna</i>, includes some extremely peculiar Hymenoptera; the males have the wing
  nervuration very much reduced, and the females are very ant-like owing to the deep constriction
  behind the first abdominal ring.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Thynnides.</b>&mdash;<i>Males and females very different in form;

    and with the thorax divided into three sub-equal parts.</i></p>

  <p>The Thynnides are by some entomologists not separated from the Mutillides; but the distinction
  in the structure of the thorax of the females is very striking. In the Thynnides the nervuration
  of the wing appears always to extend to the outer margin, and in the Mutillides not to do so. This
  family is represented in Britain by a single very rare Insect, <i>Methoca ichneumonides</i>: to
  the unskilled observer the female would appear to be without doubt an ant. This Insect is by some
  considered as the type of a family distinct from the Thynnides proper. Thynnides are numerous in
  Australia. Very little is really known as to their habits, though it has been stated that they are
  parasitic on Lepidoptera, Bakewell having obtained specimens from subterranean cocoons of that
  Order. Those who are interested in differences between the sexes of one species should examine the
  extraordinary examples of that phenomenon presented by the Thynnides; the dissimilarity throughout
  the group&mdash;which is now of considerable extent&mdash;being so extreme that no entomologist
  would from simple inspection believe the two sexes to have any connection; but the fact that they
  are so connected has been demonstrated beyond doubt. In very few <span class="pagenum"
  id="page97"><span class="smaller">{97}</span></span>cases, however, have the sexes been matched,
  so that at present males are no doubt standing in the lists of Hymenoptera as one species and
  their females as other species.</p>

  <p>This group includes some of the largest and most powerful of the Aculeate Hymenoptera. Its
  members are usually hairy Insects with thick legs, the colour being black, more or less variegated
  with bands or spots of red or yellow; the hind body is elongate, has only a very short pedicel,
  and in the male is usually terminated by three projecting spines. The pronotum is of variable
  dimensions, but its front angles are always co-adapted with the points of insertion of the front
  wings. The nervuration of the front wings is confined to the basal part, the extensive apical or
  outer area possessing no nervures. There is frequently a great difference in the size of the two
  sexes of the same species, the female being very much larger than the other sex. The larvae, so
  far as is known, devour those of Lamellicorn Coleoptera.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Fabre has investigated the habits of some of the species of Scoliides found in France, and has
  informed us that their means of subsistence consists of larvae of the larger Lamellicorn beetles,
  <i>Cetonia</i>, <i>Oryctes</i>, <i>Anoxia</i>, and <i>Euchlora</i>; these beetles belong to very
  different divisions of the Lamellicornia, but they have in common the fact that their larvae are
  of subterranean habits, living in the earth or in accumulations of d&eacute;bris in which there is a
  large proportion of vegetable matter or roots. The female <i>Scolia</i> penetrates into the ground
  in order to find the Lamellicorn larvae necessary as food for its progeny. <i>Scolia
  bifasciata</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page98"><span class="smaller">{98}</span></span>attacks
  the larvae of several species of <i>Cetonia</i>, and <i>S.</i> (<i>Colpa</i>) <i>interrupta</i>
  chooses the larvae of the chafers <i>Anoxia villosa</i> and <i>A. matutinalis</i>. The mother
  <i>Scolia</i> enters the ground in August or September, and having found a suitable larva stings
  it and deposits an egg on the ventral surface of the prey; the paralysed larva is left where it
  was found, no attempt being made to place it in a special receptacle. The egg is placed on the
  ventral surface, well behind the feet, under a mass of matter in the alimentary canal. Shortly
  after being hatched the young destroyer penetrates with its head the skin of the victim, and in
  this position commences to feed; it is necessary that it should obtain its food without killing
  the <i>Cetonia</i> larva, for it cannot prosper on decaying food, so that if the <i>Cetonia</i>
  larva die the <i>Scolia</i> larva likewise perishes; the latter, accordingly, does not withdraw
  its head from the interior of the victim, but remains always in the same position, as it grows
  larger extending its head forwards into the front part of the interior of its victim; the internal
  organs of the latter are consumed in a systematic order so as to delay bringing about its death
  till the last moment, and thus all the interior of the <i>Cetonia</i> larva is appropriated till
  nothing remains but an empty skin. By a series of experiments, Fabre showed how essential it is
  that this apparently revolting operation should be carried on with all details strictly <i>en
  r&egrave;gle</i>. If the head of the <i>Scolia</i> larva be taken out from the victim and applied to
  another part of the body of the <i>Cetonia</i>, the result is that it cannot eat; even if it be
  replaced in the original situation, after being taken away, it frequently happens that the
  <i>Cetonia</i> larva dies, its death involving also that of the destroyer. It is necessary, too,
  that the victim should be paralysed, for if an intact <i>Cetonia</i> larva be taken and bound down
  in such a position that it cannot move, and if a small orifice in its skin be made in the proper
  spot and a young <i>Scolia</i> larva be placed on it, the little parasite will avail itself of the
  opportunity and commence to feed on the larva provided for it, but the latter will speedily die,
  and the <i>Scolia</i> necessarily perishes with it. Thus both the paralysis of the victim and the
  special mode of eating are essential to the life of the <i>Scolia</i>. The operation of stinging
  the larva so as to produce the necessary paralysis, or rather insensibility, is a difficult one,
  and requires great skill and patience. The <i>Cetonia</i> larva is of large size, and must be
  pierced in one particular spot; <span class="pagenum" id="page99"><span
  class="smaller">{99}</span></span>in order to reach this the <i>Scolia</i> mounts on its victim,
  and is frequently dislodged by its struggles; sooner or later, however, the proper position is
  obtained by the wasp, and the larva is then stung in the exact spot necessary to allow the sting
  (and the poison introduced by it) to reach the most important of the nervous ganglia that control
  the movements of the body, this spot being, in the case of the <i>Cetonia</i>, the line of
  demarcation between the pro- and meso-thorax, on the middle line of the ventral surface of the
  body. The <i>Scolia</i> gives but one sting to the victim, and this it will not administer until
  it can do so exactly in the proper place. This practice of devouring the victim slowly, without
  killing it till all is eaten, is very widely spread in the Hymenoptera, and it is satisfactory to
  find that we may infer from Fabre's observations that it is not so horrible as it would at first
  appear; for it is probable that the stinging prevents decomposition of the victim, not by reason,
  as some have supposed, of the poison injected by the wasp having an antiseptic effect, but rather
  by means of destroying sensibility, so that the creature does not die from the pain, as it is
  believed it did in certain cases where Fabre induced the young <i>Scolia</i> larva to feed on a
  victim that had not been stung. We may here remark that very little exact information exists as to
  the operation of stinging. Fabre attaches great importance to the sting being inflicted on a
  nerve-ganglion. Whether a sting that did not reach this part might not have a sufficient effect
  appears, however, doubtful.<a id="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A remarkable form of Scoliides, with wings of smaller size than usual and deeply divided, has
  been described by Saunders under the name <i>Pseudomeria graeca</i>. Still more remarkable is
  <i>Komarovia victoriosa</i> found in Central Asia; in this Insect the male retains the appearance
  of a slender, pallid <i>Scolia</i>, but the female differs totally in form, and has the peculiar
  wings so reduced in size as to be useless for flight.</p>

  <p>The economy of <i>Sapyga</i>, the only genus, has been the subject of difference of opinion.
  The views of Latreille and others that these species are parasitic upon bees is confirmed by the
  observations of Fabre, from which it appears that <i>S. 5-punctata</i> lives in the burrows of
  species of the bee-genus <i>Osmia</i>, consuming the store of provisions, consisting of
  honey-paste, that the bee has laid up for its young. According to the same distinguished observer,
  the <i>Sapyga</i> larva exhibits hypermetamorphosis (<i>i.e.</i> two consecutive forms), and in
  its young state destroys the egg of the bee; but his observations on this point are incomplete and
  need repetition. We have two species of <i>Sapyga</i> in Britain; they differ in colour, and the
  sexes of <i>S. 5-punctata</i> also differ in this respect; the abdomen, spotted with white in both
  sexes is in the female variegate with red. Smith found our British <i>Sapyga 5-punctata</i>

  Diploptera, saying of it "animal quoad affinitates excrucians." We reproduce Westwood's figure,
  but not being acquainted with the Insect we can express no opinion as to whether it is allied to
  the Scoliidae or to the Sphegidae. The habits are, we believe, quite unknown.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. 2. Pompilidae.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Pronotum at the sides reaching the tegulae; hind body never definitely
    pedicellate, though the first segment is sometimes elongate and conical; hind legs long; eyes
    elliptic in form, not emarginate.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Pompilidae are perhaps the most extensive and important of the groups of Fossores, and are
  distributed over all the lands of the globe, with the exception of some islands and of the
  inclement arctic regions. The sting of the Pompilidae, unlike that of most of the Fossores,
  inflicts a burning and painful wound; the creatures sometimes attain a length of two or three
  inches, and a sting from one of these giants may have serious results. Although there is
  considerable variety in the external form of the members of the group, the characters given above
  will enable a Pompilid to be recognised with approximate certainty. The elongation of the hind
  legs includes all the parts, so that while the femur extends nearly as far back as the extremity
  of the body&mdash;in dried examples at any rate&mdash;the tibiae and the long tarsi extend far
  beyond it; thus these Insects have great powers of running; they are indeed remarkable for extreme
  activity and vivacity. They may frequently be seen running rapidly on the surface of the ground,
  with quivering wings and vibrating antennae, and are probably then employed in the search for
  prey, or some other of the operations connected with providing a store of food for their young.
  Spiders appear to be their special, if not their only, prey. Several authors have recorded details
  as to the various ways in which the prey is attacked. Fabre has observed the habits of several
  species, and we select his account of the <i>modus operandi</i> of species of the genera
  <i>Pompilus</i> and <i>Calicurgus</i>, in their attacks on poisonous spiders that inhabit holes in
  the ground or in walls. The wasp goes to the mouth of the spider's burrow, and the latter then
  dashes to the entry, apparently enraged at the audacity of its persecutor.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page102"><span class="smaller">{102}</span></span></div>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <p class="sp0">Fig. 43.&mdash;<i>Calicurgus hyalinatus</i> &#x2640;. Britain.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <i>Calicurgus</i> will not actually enter a burrow when there is a spider in it, because if
  it did so the spider would speedily dispose of the aggressor by the aid of its poisonous fangs.
  The <i>Calicurgus</i>, therefore, has recourse to strategy with the object of getting the spider
  out of its nest; the wasp seizes its redoubtable foe by one foot and pulls; probably it fails to
  extract the spider, and in that case rapidly passes to another burrow to repeat its tactics;
  sooner or later a spider is in some moment of inattention or incapacity dragged from its
  stronghold, and, being then comparatively helpless, feels itself at a disadvantage and offers but
  a feeble resistance to the wasp, which now pounces on its body and immediately inflicts a sting
  between the fangs of the foe, and thus at once paralyses these dangerous weapons; thereafter it
  stings the body of the spider near to the junction of the abdomen and cephalothorax, and so
  produces complete inactivity. Having secured its prey, the wasp then seeks a suitable hole in
  which to deposit it; probably an empty burrow of a spider is selected for the purpose, and it may
  be at a height of several feet in a wall; the Hymenopteron, walking backwards, drags its heavy
  prey up the wall to bring it to the den. When this is accomplished an egg is deposited on the
  spider, and the wasp goes in search of a fragment or two of mortar, with which the mouth of the
  burrow is finally blocked. Fabre's accounts refer to the habits of several species, and give a
  good insight into some points of the instincts of both the spider and the wasp. It seems that a
  sense of superiority is produced in one or other of the foes, according as it feels itself in
  suitable conditions; so that though a spider out of its burrow and on the ground is speedily
  vanquished by the Pompilid, yet if the two be confined together in a vase, both are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page103"><span class="smaller">{103}</span></span>shy and inclined to adopt
  defensive or even evasive tactics, the result probably being that the wasp will be killed by the
  spider during the night, that being the period in which the attacking powers of the spider are
  more usually brought into play.</p>

  <p>It seems to be the habit of some <i>Pompilus</i> to procure a victim before they have secured a
  place for its reception; and Fabre took advantage of this fact, and made very interesting
  observations on some points of the instinct of these wasps. Having found a <i>Pompilus</i> that,
  after having caught a spider and paralysed it, was engaged in making a retreat for its reception,
  he abstracted the booty, which was deposited at the top of a small tuft of vegetation near to
  where the <i>Pompilus</i> was at work. In this case the burrow in course of preparation was
  subterranean, and was formed by the <i>Pompilus</i> itself, which therefore could not, while it
  was engaged underground, see what took place near it. It is the habit of the wasp to leave its
  work of excavation from time to time, and to visit the prey as if to assure itself of the safety
  of this object, and to enjoy the satisfaction of touching it with the mouth and palping it.
  Desirous of testing the wasp's memory of locality, Fabre took the opportunity, while the Insect
  was working at the formation of its burrow, of removing, as we have said, the booty from the place
  where it had been deposited, and putting it in another spot some half-yard off. In a short time
  the <i>Pompilus</i> suspended work and went straight to the spot where it had deposited its
  property, and finding this absent, entered on a series of marches, counter-marches, and circles
  round the spot where it had left the prey, as if quite sure that this was really the place where
  the desired object ought to be. At last convinced that the paralysed prey was no longer where it
  had been placed, the <i>Pompilus</i> made investigations at a greater distance and soon discovered
  the spider. Fabre recounts that its movements then appeared to indicate astonishment at the change
  of position that it thus ascertained to have occurred. The wasp, however, soon satisfied itself
  that this was really the very object it was seeking, and seizing the spider by the leg slightly
  altered its position by placing it on the summit of a small tuft of vegetation; this latter
  proceeding being apparently always carried out by this species of <i>Pompilus</i>. Then it
  returned to its excavation, and Fabre again removed the spider to a third spot; the wasp when it
  next rested from its work made its way <span class="pagenum" id="page104"><span
  class="smaller">{104}</span></span>immediately to the second spot, where it had last left the
  spider, thus showing that it possessed an accurate memory for locality; the wasp was very much
  surprised at the absence of the valued prize and persisted in seeking it in the immediate vicinity
  without once returning to the place where it had been first located. Fabre repeated this manoeuvre
  five times, and the <i>Pompilus</i> invariably returned at once to the spot where it had last left
  its prey. The acute memory for localities displayed by this Insect seems to be more or less
  general throughout the Aculeate Hymenoptera, and is of very great importance to them. The power of
  finding the object appears to depend on sight, for when Fabre, after removing the spider to a
  fresh spot, made a slight depression in the ground, placed the spider in it and covered it over
  with a leaf, the wasp did not find it. At the same time, the Insect's sight must be a very
  different sense from our own, for the wasp, when seeking its lost booty, frequently passed within
  a couple of inches of it without perceiving it, though it was not concealed.</p>

  <p>Belt gives an example of the habits of the Mexican <i>Pompilus polistoides</i>. He noticed it,
  when hunting for spiders, make a dart at a web in the centre of which a spider was stationed; by
  this movement the creature was frightened and fell to the ground, where it was seized by the wasp
  and stung. The <i>Pompilus</i> then dragged its prisoner up a tree and afterwards flew off with
  it, the burden being probably too heavy for conveyance to the nest without the vantage of an
  elevation to start from.</p>

  <p>Several modifications adopted by Pompilidae in their mode of stinging their spider-victims have
  been recorded by Ferton; these we cannot allude to in detail, but will nevertheless mention that
  one species stings the body of its spider-prey at random, and that in other cases it would appear
  that the paralysis of the spider is evanescent. In short, there are various degrees of perfection
  in the details of the art of stinging.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable of the forms of Pompilidae are the numerous species of <i>Pepsis</i>, a
  genus peculiar to America, whence upwards of 200 species are already known.<a id="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> Some of them attain a length of two inches or more, and are able
  to conquer the largest spiders; even the formidable <i>Mygale avicularis</i> succumbs to their
  agility and skill. Some of these <i>Pepsis</i> have beautifully coloured wings; according to
  Cameron, this may be <span class="pagenum" id="page105"><span
  class="smaller">{105}</span></span>due to scales. <i>P. formosus</i>, Say, is called in Texas the
  tarantula-killer; according to Buckley, its mode of attack on the huge spider is different from
  that made use of by its European ally. When it discovers a tarantula it flies "in circles in the
  air, around its victim. The spider, as if knowing its fate, stands up and makes a show of
  fighting, but the resistance is very feeble and of no avail. The spider's foe soon discovers a
  favourable moment and darts upon the tarantula, whom it wounds with its sting, and again commences
  flying in circles." The natural retreat of this huge spider, <i>Mygale hentzii</i>, is in holes in
  the ground, and this account does not inform us whether the spider allows itself to be overcome
  when in its nest, or is only attacked when out of its retreat.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Mygnimia</i> includes a very large number of species, and has a wider geographical
  distribution than <i>Pepsis</i>, being found in the tropical regions of both the Old and New
  Worlds, some of them rivalling in size and ferocity the larger specimens of the genus
  <i>Pepsis</i>. In the Insects of this genus there is usually a more or less distinct small space
  of more pallid colour on the middle of each front wing. <i>Parapompilus</i> is a curious genus
  consisting of Insects of a great variety of peculiar coloration, and having the wings short, so as
  to be of little use for flight. <i>P. gravesii</i> is an inhabitant of Chili.</p>

  <p><i>Agenia carbonaria</i> and <i>A. hyalipennis</i> are small and feeble Insects inhabiting the
  south of Europe. <i>A. carbonaria</i> extends to the south of England. They construct, as nests
  for their offspring, small earthenware vessels, differing in form according to the species, those
  of <i>A. hyalipennis</i> being vase-like in shape, while those of <i>A. carbonaria</i> are
  contracted near the mouth, something after the fashion of a wide-mouthed bottle. The Insect is
  able by some means&mdash;Fabre thinks by the use of saliva&mdash;to varnish the interior of the
  vessel so that it will not absorb water; the outside of the cells is, however, not so protected,
  and speedily crumbles away when exposed to the action of water; hence the vessel is placed in a
  protected situation, such as in a tree-stump, or a hole in a wall, or even in an empty snail-shell
  under a heap of stones. The cells are stored with spiders that have been paralysed by stinging and
  that serve as food for the larva of the <i>Agenia</i>. The larva of <i>A. carbonaria</i> has been
  described, and some particulars as to its habits have been given by Verhoeff. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page106"><span class="smaller">{106}</span></span>It has been stated that this
  wasp does not paralyse its prey by stinging, but substitutes a process of biting to prevent the
  spider from hurting the larva that is to feed on it; and Verhoeff's observations seem to show that
  the legs of the spider are broken by some proceeding of the kind. The <i>Agenia</i> larva is of
  peculiar shape, the head not being inflexed, while the pleurae of each segment, from the second
  onwards, are prominent, so as to give the outline of the body a scalloped appearance. This larva
  is much infested by an Ichneumon that devours, it appears, not only the larva itself, but also the
  spider that was destined to be food for the larva. Verhoeff seems to have found some evidence that
  <i>Pompilus sericeus</i> may also be a parasite on the <i>Agenia</i>.</p>

  <p>The construction of earthenware cells, instead of the burrows usual in Pompilidae, by the
  species of this genus is one of the cases alluded to in our introductory remarks as to allied
  Fossores exhibiting different habits. Mr. Pride has recently sent us from Brazil similar earthen
  vessels constructed by some Pompilid.</p>

  <p>The habits of Pompilids of the genus <i>Ceropales</i> are analogous to those of the parasitic
  bees. P&eacute;rez has recently given us information as to a very curious form of parasitism in this
  genus; he says that when a <i>Pompilus</i> has obtained a spider as provision for its young, it is
  pursued by a <i>Ceropales</i>, which lays an egg on the spider, thus as it were substituting in
  advance its own young for that of the <i>Pompilus</i>. Information as to the subsequent course of
  events in this case is not at present forthcoming. In another case a <i>Ceropales</i> was observed
  to oviposit on the spider, not while this is being carried in, but subsequently by entering the
  nest for the purpose; a habit quite similar to that of some parasitic bees. Ferton has recently
  made the unexpected discovery that some <i>Pompilus</i> act as robbers; one individual taking away
  by force the spider that another has captured and is carrying off.</p>

  <p>Lichtenstein described a Pompilid larva, that he afterwards ascertained to be <i>Calicurgus
  hyalinatus</i>, as possessing the extraordinary habit of feeding as an external parasite fixed to
  the dorsal surface of a spider; thus repeating, it would appear, the habits of some of the
  Ichnemonidae, though the perfect Insect (Fig. 143) does not differ in structure from its
  congeners. Emery has given an account of some Pompilids that do not bury their prey, but after
  stinging it and depositing an egg, simply leave the spider on the spot.</p>

  <p>Buller has described the habits of a Pompilid in New Zealand; his account is interesting
  because it shows a remarkable similarity in the proceedings of this antipodean wasp to those of
  its congeners on our own side of the world. The species is not scientifically named, but it
  appears that it is known in New Zealand as "the Mason-bee." It forms a nest of yellow clay
  consisting apparently of about eight cells, each of which is filled with one or more spiders in a
  paralysed condition. The figure given of the larva of this Insect by Buller shows it to possess a
  peculiarly formed head.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is pleasing to find that Pompilidae do not make use of cruel methods when others
  will serve their purpose. We are informed that a large Australian Pompilid&mdash;<i>Priocnemis
  bicolor</i>&mdash;may find a <i>Cicada</i> sucking sap from a hole it has pierced in a tree. The
  <i>Priocnemis</i> has not the art of making the puncture necessary to procure sap, so the wasp
  seizes the <i>Cicada</i>, and shakes it till it leaves its hold and flies away, when the
  <i>Priocnemis</i> takes its place and sips the sap. It is added that the wasp never hurts the
  Cicada.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This group includes a great number of species, about 200 of which are referred to the genus
  <i>Sphex</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page108"><span class="smaller">{108}</span></span></div>

  <p>The habits of one species of this genus have been fully described by Fabre; he assigns to the
  species the name of <i>S. flavipennis</i>, but Kohl considers that it is more probably <i>S.
  maxillosus</i>. This Insect forms its nests, in the South of France, in the ground, excavating a
  main shaft with which are connected cells intended for the reception of the provisions for the
  young. The entrance to the burrow is formed by piercing a hole in the side of a very slight
  elevation of the soil. Thus the entrance to the construction consists of a horizontal gallery,
  playing the part of a vestibule, and this is used by the <i>Sphex</i> as a place of retreat and
  shelter for itself; at the end of the vestibule, which may be two or three inches long, the
  excavation takes an abrupt turn downwards, extending in this manner another two or three inches,
  and terminating in an oval cell the larger diameter of which is situate in a horizontal plane.
  When this first cell has been completed, stored with food, and an egg laid in it, the entrance to
  it is blocked up, and another similar cell is formed on one side; a third and sometimes a fourth
  are afterwards made and provisioned, then the Insect commences anew, and a fresh tunnel is formed;
  ten such constructions being the number usually prepared by each wasp. The Insect works with
  extreme energy, and as the period of its constructive activity endures only about a month, it can
  give but two or three days to the construction and provisioning of each of its ten subterranean
  works. The provisions, according to Fabre, consist of a large species of field-cricket, of which
  three or four individuals are placed in each cell. Kohl states, however, that in Eastern Europe an
  Insect that he considers to be the same species as Fabre's <i>Sphex</i>, makes use of locusts as
  provisions, and he thinks that the habit may vary according to the locality or to the species of
  Orthoptera that may be available in the neighbourhood. However that may be, it is clear from
  Fabre's account that this part of the <i>Sphex's</i> duties do not give rise to much difficulty.
  The cricket, having been caught, is paralysed so that it may not by its movements destroy the
  young larva for whose benefit it is destined. The <i>Sphex</i> then carries it to the burrow to
  store it in one of the cells; before entering the cell the Insect is in the habit of depositing
  its prey on the ground, then of turning round, entering the burrow backwards, seizing as it does
  so the cricket by the antennae, and so dragging it into the cell, itself going <span
  class="pagenum" id="page109"><span class="smaller">{109}</span></span>backwards. The habit of
  depositing its prey on the ground enabled Fabre to observe the process of stinging; this he did by
  himself capturing a cricket, and when the wasp had momentarily quitted its prey, substituting the
  sound cricket for the paralysed one. The <i>Sphex</i>, on finding this new and lively victim,
  proceeds at once to sting it, and pounces on the cricket, which, after a brief struggle, is
  overcome by the wasp; this holds it supine, and then administers three stings, one in the neck,
  one in the joint between the pro- and meso-thorax, and a third at the base of the abdomen, these
  three spots corresponding with the situation of the three chief nervous centres governing the
  movements of the body. The cricket is thus completely paralysed, without, however, being killed.
  Fabre proved that an Insect so treated would survive for several weeks, though deprived of all
  power of movement. Three or four crickets are placed by the wasp in each cell, 100 individuals or
  upwards being thus destroyed by a single wasp. Although the sting has such an immediate and
  powerful effect on the cricket, it occasions but a slight and evanescent pain to a human being;
  the sting is not barbed, as it is in many bees and true wasps, and appears to be rarely used by
  the Insect for any other purpose than that of paralysing its victims. The egg is laid by the
  <i>Sphex</i> on the ventral surface of the victim between the second and third pairs of legs. In
  three or four days the young larva makes its appearance in the form of a feeble little worm, as
  transparent as crystal; this larva does not change its place, but there, where it was hatched,
  pierces the skin of the cricket with its tiny head, and thus begins the process of feeding; it
  does not leave the spot where it first commenced to feed, but gradually enters by the orifice it
  has made, into the interior of the cricket. This is completely emptied in the course of six or
  seven days, nothing but its integument remaining; the wasp-larva has by this time attained a
  length of about 12 millimetres, and makes its exit through the orifice it entered by, changing its
  skin as it does so. Another cricket is then attacked and rapidly consumed, the whole stock being
  devoured in ten or twelve days from the commencement of the feeding operations; the consumption of
  the later-eaten crickets is not performed in so delicate a manner as is the eating of the first
  victim. When full-grown, the process of forming a cocoon commences: this is a very elaborate
  operation, for the encasement consists of three layers, in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page110"><span class="smaller">{110}</span></span>addition to the rough silk that serves as a
  sort of scaffolding on the exterior: the internal coat is polished and is of a dark colour, owing
  to its being coloured with a matter from the alimentary canal: the other layers of the cocoon are
  white or pale yellow. Fabre considers that the outer layers of the cocoon are formed by matter
  from the silk-glands, while the interior dark coat is furnished by the alimentary canal and
  applied by the mouth of the larva: the object of this varnish is believed to be the exclusion of
  moisture from the interior of the cocoon, the subterranean tunnels being insufficient for keeping
  their contents dry throughout the long months of winter. During the whole of the process of
  devouring the four crickets, nothing is ejected from the alimentary canal of the larva, but after
  the cocoon is formed the larva ejects in it, once for all, the surplus contents of the intestine.
  Nine months are passed by the Insect in the cocoon, the pupal state being assumed only towards the
  close of this period. The pupa is at first quite colourless, but gradually assumes the black and
  red colour characteristic of the perfect wasp. Fabre exposed some specimens of the pupa to the
  light in glass tubes, and found that they went through the pupal metamorphosis in just the same
  manner as the pupae that remained in the darkness natural to them during this stage of their
  existence.</p>

  <p><i>Sphex coeruleus</i> is frequently stated to have the habit of provisioning its nests with
  both Orthoptera and Spiders; but Kohl considers with reason that this record is, as regards
  spiders, a mistake, arising probably from a confusion with some other Insect of similar
  appearance, such as <i>Pelopaeus</i> (<i>Sceliphron</i>) <i>coeruleus</i>. <i>S. coeruleus</i> is
  no doubt the same as <i>S.</i> (<i>Chlorion</i>) <i>lobatus</i>, which Rothney observed in East
  India, provisioning its nests with Orthoptera. He discovered a nest in process of construction,
  and during the absence of the mother-wasp abstracted from the burrow a large field-cricket that
  she had placed in it; he then deposited the Orthopteron near the cell; the parent <i>Sphex</i> on
  returning to work entered the tunnel and found the provision placed therein had disappeared; she
  came out in a state of excitement, looked for the missing cricket, soon discovered it, submitted
  it to the process of malaxation or kneading, and again placed it in the nest, after having cleared
  it from some ants that had commenced to infest it. She then disappeared, and Rothney repeated the
  experiment; in due course the same series <span class="pagenum" id="page111"><span
  class="smaller">{111}</span></span>of operations was performed, and were repeated many times, the
  <i>Sphex</i> evidently acting in each case as if either the cricket had disappeared owing to its
  being incompletely stunned, or to its having been stolen by ants. Finally, the observer placed the
  cricket at a greater distance from the nest, when it recovered from the ill-treatment it had
  received sufficiently to make its escape. The points of interest in this account are the fact that
  the cricket was only temporarily paralysed, and that the wasp was quite able to cope with the two
  special difficulties that must frequently occur to the species in its usual round of
  occupations.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Ammophila</i> is of wide distribution, and its species make vertical tunnels in
  the ground. The habits of some of the species found in France have been described by Fabre. The
  Insect does not inhabit the burrow while it is in process of formation, but quits it; and some of
  the species temporarily close the entry to the incomplete nest with a stone. The tunnel is a
  simple shaft with a single cell at its termination; this is stored with caterpillars, the
  different species of <i>Ammophila</i> selecting different grubs for the purpose. <i>A. hirsuta</i>
  hibernates in the perfect state, and carries on its work in the spring; it chooses a single larva
  of considerable size belonging to one of the nocturnal Lepidoptera, and this it paralyses by a
  series of about nine stings, of which one is implanted in each segment from the first thoracic
  ring backwards; it forms the burrow only after the food to be placed therein has been obtained.
  The caterpillar used is subterranean in habit, and the <i>Ammophila</i> detects the larva by some
  sense, the nature of which appears at present quite uncertain. <i>A. holosericea</i> chooses
  smaller larvae of the family Geometridae, and uses only one or two stingings to paralyse each
  larva; several caterpillars are used to provision a single cell, and they are often selected of
  different colours.</p>

  <p>Marchal has also published an important account of the proceedings of <i>A. affinis</i>; he
  confirms Fabre's observations, and even adds to their interest by suggesting that the
  <i>Ammophila</i> administers special stings for the purpose of paralysing the mandibles of the
  caterpillar and depriving it of any power of afterwards injuring the larva that will feed on it.
  He thinks the mother-<i>Ammophila</i> herself profits by appropriating an exudation from the
  victim.</p>

  <p>Some species of Sphegides have the curious habit of choosing <span class="pagenum"
  id="page112"><span class="smaller">{112}</span></span>the interiors of human habitations as the
  spots most suitable for the formation of their own domestic establishments. Fabre has given a
  charming account of the habits of <i>Pelopaeus</i> (<i>Sceliphron</i>) <i>spirifex</i>, a species
  that inhabits the South of Europe, and that forms its nests in the cottages of the peasants. The
  spot usually selected is a nook in the broad, open fireplace, out of reach of the flames, though
  not of the smoke; here the <i>Pelopaeus</i> forms a nest of earth, consisting of ten to fifty
  cells, the material being mud or clay brought in little balls by the aid of the Insect's
  mandibles; about twenty visits are required in order to complete one cell, so that for the
  construction of a large nest of fifty cells, about one thousand visits must be made by the Insect.
  It flies in and out of the house apparently not at all incommoded by the human habitants, or by
  the fact that the peasant's potage may be simmering on the fire quite close to where the fearless
  little creature is carrying on its architectural operations. The cells are stored with spiders, of
  which the wasp has to bring a plentiful supply, so that its operations extend over a considerable
  period. The prey is captured by the <i>Pelopaeus</i> whilst on the wing, and carried off at once,
  being probably stung by the wasp during the process of transit; apparently it is killed by the
  operation, not merely paralysed. Only small spiders are taken by this species, and the larva of
  the <i>Pelopaeus</i> consumes them in a short time, one by one, before the process of
  decomposition sets in; the egg, too, is laid on the first spider introduced, and this is of course
  at the bottom of the cell, so that the spiders are eaten by the wasp's larva in the order in which
  they were brought to the cell. The cell is sealed up when full, the number of spiders placed in it
  being on the average about eight. The larva completes its task of consuming the store in about ten
  days, and then forms a cocoon for its metamorphosis. Two or three generations are produced in a
  single year, the autumnal one passing eight or nine months in the clay cells, which are lodged in
  a nook of the peasant's hearth, and exposed to the smoke of his fire during all the months of
  winter. <i>Pelopaeus</i> (<i>Sceliphron</i>) is a genus including many species;<a id="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> several of them are known <span class="pagenum"
  id="page113"><span class="smaller">{113}</span></span>to be specially attached to the habitations
  of human beings. Roth has given an account of the habits of <i>P.</i> (<i>Sceliphron</i>)
  <i>laetus</i> in Australia; he says that in some parts it is very difficult to keep these wasps
  out of the houses; the nest is formed of mud, and constructed on the furniture or in any part of a
  room that suits the fancy of the Insect. This it must be admitted is, according to human ideas,
  liable to the charge of being very capricious. Roth timed a wasp building its nest, and found that
  it brought a fresh load of mud every two or three minutes. If the wasp be allowed to complete the
  nest undisturbed, she does so by adding to the exterior diagonal streaks of mud, so giving to the
  nest the look of a small piece of the bark of a common acacia. The construction consists of from
  ten to twenty cells, and when completed is provisioned with spiders for the use of the young. This
  wasp is much pestered by parasites, some of which prevent the development of the larvae by
  consuming the spiders intended by the mother-wasp for its young. A fly, of the Order Diptera, is
  said to follow the wasp when carrying a spider, and to deposit also an egg on the food; as the
  Dipterous larvae have more rapid powers of assimilation, the <i>Pelopaeus</i> larvae are starved
  to death; and their mildewed remains may be found in the cell, after their enemies have become
  fully developed and have flown away. Another parasite is said to eat the wasp-larva, and attains
  this end by introducing an egg through the mud wall and the cocoon of the wasp&mdash;a habit that
  seems to indicate a <i>Leucospid</i> parasite. <i>Tachytes australis</i>, a wasp of the sub-family
  Larrides also dispossesses this <i>Pelopaeus</i> in a manner we shall subsequently describe. This
  fragment of natural history from Australia has a special interest, for we find repeated there
  similar complex biological relations to those existing in the case of the European congeners.</p>

  <p><i>P.</i> (<i>Sceliphron</i>) <i>madraspatanus</i> is common in the north-west provinces of
  Hindostan, and is called the "mud-dauber" by the European residents. According to Horne it
  constructs its cells in the oddest places, but chiefly about the inhabited apartments in houses.
  It is perfectly fearless when engaged in building: the cells are four to six in number, and are
  usually provisioned with spiders to the number of about twenty. On one occasion it was observed
  that green caterpillars were stored instead of <span class="pagenum" id="page114"><span
  class="smaller">{114}</span></span>spiders. The species is said to be protected by a peculiar
  odour as well as by its sting; it is also stated that it disguises its edifice when completed by
  making it look like a dab of mud, and on one occasion "rays of mud were observed round the nest,
  even more exactly imitating a lump of mud thrown with some force." <i>P.</i> (<i>Sceliphron</i>)
  <i>bilineatus</i>, formerly thought to be a variety of <i>P. madraspatanus</i>, builds its nests
  in hedges and trees.</p>

  <p>This is one of the smallest of the divisions of the Sphegidae, but has a very wide
  distribution, being represented in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. It is allied to the
  Sphegides, but differs by the prolongation of the neck and of the head, and by the articulation
  between the petiole and thorax being placed on the under surface of the body; the wing-nervures
  are said to be of inferior importance owing to their frequently differing in individuals of the
  same species. These Insects appear to be rare in individuals, as well as few in species, and but
  little has been recorded as to their habits; but it is known that they live on cockroaches.
  Perkins has given a brief sketch of the habits of <i>Ampulex sibirica</i> that is of great
  interest, but requires confirmation. He says that this Insect, in West Africa, enters apartments
  where cockroaches abound, and attacking one, that may probably be four times its own size,
  succeeds, after a struggle, in stinging it; the cockroach instantly becomes quiet and submissive,
  and suffers itself to be led away and placed in confinement in some <span class="pagenum"
  id="page115"><span class="smaller">{115}</span></span>spot such as a keyhole, and in one case was
  apparently prevented from afterwards escaping, by the wasp carrying some heavy nails into the
  keyhole. The larva of the <i>Ampulex</i> may be presumed to live on the Blattid, as it is added
  that dead bodies of the cockroaches are frequently found with the empty cocoon protruding from
  them. This account, if correct, points to some features in the habits of this Insect that are
  unique. A remark made by Rothney in reference to the habits of <i>A.</i> (<i>Rhinopsis</i>)
  <i>ruficornis</i> seems to indicate some similar instinct on the part of that species; he says, "I
  also saw two or three of these wasps collar a peculiar cockroach by the antennae and lead it off
  into a crack in the bark, but as the cockroach reappeared smiling each time, I don't know what was
  up." The same observer records that this species associates with <i>Sima rufonigra</i>, an ant it
  greatly resembles in appearance, as well as with a spider that is also of similar appearance (Fig.
  72). Schurr has given a brief account of the proceedings of <i>Ampulex compressa</i>, and his
  statements also tend to confirm the correctness of Perkins' report. The habits of a species of
  <i>Ampulex</i> were partially known to R&eacute;aumur, who described them on the authority of M.
  Cossigni. The species is believed to be <i>A. compressa</i>, which occurs not only in East India,
  but also in the island of Bourbon, the locality where M. Cossigni made his observation: his
  account is, like the others, a mere sketch of certain points observed, the most important of which
  is that when <i>Ampulex</i> cannot introduce the cockroach into a hole that it has selected as
  suitable, it bites off some portions of the body in order to reduce the poor Insect to the
  necessary extent.</p>

  <p>From these fragmentary observations it would appear that the sting of the <i>Ampulex</i> has
  not so powerful a paralysing effect as that of most other Fossores; and that the <i>Ampulex</i>
  does not form any nest, but takes advantage of suitable holes and crevices to store the victim in;
  also that it displays considerable ingenuity in the selection of materials with which to block up
  the cavity in which it has placed the partially incapacitated creature.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Dolichurus</i> is by some entomologists considered the type of a sub-family allied
  to the Ampulicides; it long consisted of a small and rare European Insect, but some exotic species
  have recently been added to it. It will probably prove not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page116"><span class="smaller">{116}</span></span>sufficiently distinct from Ampulicides,
  although the pronotum is much shorter, but Handlirsch has recently observed that the European
  species attacks Blattidae as do the normal Ampulicides; and Ferton has recorded that <i>D.
  haemorrhous</i> lives at the expense of <i>Loboptera decipiens</i>, the wasp depositing its egg on
  the left intermediate femur of the prey. This is placed in a solitary cell, and is entirely
  consumed by the larva, life being preserved till within a few hours of the end of the repast,
  which occupies altogether eight days.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This group is by some writers called Tachytides instead of Larrides, as owing to a change of
  nomenclature <i>Tachytes</i> may now be considered its principal genus. It is in connection with
  this and the neighbouring sub-families of Sphegidae that some of the greatest taxonomical
  difficulties exist. We include in Larrides the "<i>Miscophus</i> group" of Kohl.</p>

  <p>The species of the genus <i>Tachytes</i> seem to have habits very similar to those of the genus
  <i>Sphex</i>; they form shafts in the earth and provision them with Orthoptera; like the
  <i>Sphex</i> and other Fossores, they have the habit, when they fly to their tunnel with a victim,
  of depositing it for a short time on the ground close to the mouth of the burrow while they turn
  round and enter backwards; and, after doing this they again seize their prey and drag it into the
  burrow. Fabre availed himself of an opportunity to remove the prey while the Hymenopteron was
  entering the hole alone; as a result it had to come out again to seek the object; this it soon
  found, and carried to the hole, relinquishing it again as usual while it turned round; Fabre
  repeated the operation several times, and always with the same result; the wasp, though it might
  have kept hold of the victim while it turned, and thus have saved itself from losing the precious
  object, never did so.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page117"><span class="smaller">{117}</span></span></div>

  <p>One species of <i>Tachytes</i> in the south of France selects as its prey Orthoptera of the
  family Mantidae, Insects of a highly ferocious disposition, and provided with most powerful front
  legs, capable of cutting in two by a single act the body of an aggressor like the <i>Tachytes</i>;
  the latter is, however, by no means dismayed by the arms of its future victim, but hovering above
  the latter for some time, as if to confuse it, and causing it repeatedly to turn its very mobile
  head, the <i>Tachytes</i> at last pounces down and instantaneously stings the <i>Mantis</i> in the
  nerve centre between the formidable arms, which at once are reduced to incapacity; subsequently
  the <i>Tachytes</i> paralyses each of the other pairs of legs, and then carries off its
  victim.</p>

  <p><i>Larra anathema</i> chooses mole-crickets as the viand for its young, and <i>Tachysphex
  panzeri</i> selects grasshoppers of the family Acridiidae. <i>Larra pompiliformis</i> (=
  <i>Tachytes niger</i>, Fabre) sometimes associates itself with <i>Sphex flavipennis</i> (<i>? S.
  maxillosus</i>, according to Kohl), forming its burrow amidst the works of a colony of that
  species, and making use, like the <i>Sphex</i>, of crickets for provender. This led Fabre to
  believe that the <i>Larra</i> stole its prey from the <i>Sphex</i>, but he has since withdrawn
  this indictment, and declares that the <i>Larra</i> obtains its crickets by the more honourable,
  if not more humane, process of catching and stinging them itself. Smith has informed us, on the
  faith of his own observation, that <i>L. pompiliformis</i> uses both Lepidopterous larvae and
  grasshoppers for its stores.</p>

  <p><i>T.</i> (<i>Larrada</i>) <i>australis</i>, according to Whittell, plays the part of a
  burglar, breaking open the cells of <i>Pelopaeus</i> (<i>Sceliphron</i>) <i>laetus</i> after they
  have been completed and stored with spiders; it then takes possession of the cell, and curiously
  enough the <i>Pelopaeus</i> permits this, although the cell contains its egg and the store of food
  that is intended for the use of its own young. To us this seems very strange, but it is probable
  that the <i>Pelopaeus</i> has no idea of the consequences of the intruder's operations; <span
  class="pagenum" id="page118"><span class="smaller">{118}</span></span>it being one of the strange
  facts of nature that these highly endowed creatures never even see the offspring for whose welfare
  they labour with such extraordinary ingenuity and perseverance. Neither can we suppose that they
  have a conception of it derived from a knowledge of their own individual history; for their very
  complete metamorphosis is scarcely reconcilable with any such recollection on their part. It may
  possibly therefore be the case that, having no idea whatever of the offspring, they are equally
  destitute of any conception that it will be destroyed by the operations of the <i>Larrada</i>.
  However this may be, Whittell informs us that both wasps skirmish about for a little as if each
  were mistrustful and somewhat afraid of the other; this ends by the <i>Pelopaeus</i> withdrawing
  its opposition and by the <i>Larrada</i> taking possession of the cell, which it then proceeds to
  divide into two, using for the purpose of the partition portions of the material of the nest
  itself; possibly it is only a contraction of the size of the cell, not a true division, that is
  effected; however this may be, after it is accomplished the <i>Larrada</i> deposits its own egg in
  the cell, having, it is believed by Whittell, previously destroyed that of the <i>Pelopaeus</i>.
  Judging from what occurs in other species it is, however, more probable that the destruction of
  the egg or young of the <i>Pelopaeus</i> is carried out by the larva of the <i>Larrada</i> and not
  by the parent-wasp. From a remark made by Maindron as to the proceedings of <i>Larrada
  modesta</i>, in Ternate, it seems probable that its habits may prove to be similar to those of
  <i>L. australis</i>, for it frequents the nests of <i>Pelopaeus</i> after they have been
  completed.</p>

  <p>We have two species of the genus <i>Astata</i> in Britain: one of them&mdash;<i>A.
  boops</i>&mdash;is known to form burrows in the ground, each of which contains only a single cell;
  this, it appears, is usually provisioned with bugs of the genus <i>Pentatoma</i>, Insects
  remarkable for their strong and offensive odour. St. Fargeau records that this species also makes
  use of a small cockroach for forming the food-store: thus exhibiting an unique catholicity in the
  toleration of the disagreeable; almost the only point of connection between bugs and cockroaches
  being their disagreeable character. According to Smith, <i>Oxybelus</i>, another genus of
  Fossores, is also used. Authorities are far from agreement as to the validity and relations of the
  sub-family Astatides. It consists only of the widely-distributed genus <i>Astata</i>, with which

  <p>The elongation of the labrum, though one of the most trustworthy of the characters of the

  class="smaller">{120}</span></span>relied on owing to the variation it presents both in this and
  the allied sub-families. The Bembecides carry their prey to their young tucked underneath their
  own bodies and hugged to the breast; they affect loose, sandy soils for nidification; make use, in
  the great majority of the cases where the habits are known, of Diptera for provisions, and give
  these dead to the young; making repeated visits to supply fresh food to the progeny, which
  notwithstanding this fact, are distributed in isolated burrows.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Fig. 47.&mdash;<i>Bembex rostrata</i> &#x2642;. Europe.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the most interesting of Fabre's studies of the instincts of Hymenoptera is devoted to
  <i>Bembex rostrata</i>. The Bembecides have the habit of forming their nests in the ground in wide
  expanses of sand, and of covering them up, they leave them so that there appears to be absolutely
  nothing by which the exact position of the nest can be traced; nevertheless the <i>Bembex</i>
  flies direct to it without any hesitation. How necessary it is to these Insects to possess this
  faculty of finding their nests will be understood when we recall that the <i>Bembex</i> does not
  provision its nest once and for all, but supplies the young at first with only insufficient food,
  and has therefore to return at daily, or other intervals, with a fresh store of provisions. The
  burrow is made in the sand by means of the fore-legs; these work with such rapidity and skill that
  a constant stream of sand flows out behind the Insect while it is engaged in the act of
  excavation. The nest or cell in which the larva is to live, is formed by this process of digging;
  but no fastening together of the material occurs, nor does any expedient seem to be resorted to,
  other than that of making a way through the sand by clearing out all the pieces of stick or stone
  that might diminish facility of access. The cell being formed, the <i>Bembex</i> leaves the spot
  in search of prey, and when it has secured a victim in the shape of a two-winged fly, it returns
  therewith to the burrow, and the booty is placed therein, an egg being deposited on it. The wasp
  then leaves the burrow, disguising, however, the spot where it is situate, and flies away; to
  proceed possibly with the formation <span class="pagenum" id="page121"><span
  class="smaller">{121}</span></span>of other burrows.<a id="NtA_53"
  href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> In the course of twenty-four hours the egg hatches, and the
  larva in two or three days completely devours the stock provided for it. The mother-wasp then
  returns with another fly&mdash;this time probably a larger one&mdash;penetrates rapidly to the
  bottom of the burrow, and again retreats, leaving the second stock of provisions for the benefit
  of the greedy larva. These visits of supply are repeated with increased frequency, as the appetite
  of the larva for the benefit of which they are made increases with its growth. During the fourteen
  or fifteen days that form this portion of the life-cycle, the single larva is supplied with no
  less than fifty to eighty flies for food. To furnish this quantum, numerous visits are made to
  each burrow, and as the mother <i>Bembex</i> has several burrows&mdash;though how many does not
  appear to be known&mdash;her industry at this time must be very great. All the while, too, a great
  danger has to be avoided, for there is an enemy that sees in the booty brought by the
  <i>Bembex</i> to its young, a rich store for its own progeny. This enemy is a feeble, two-winged
  fly of the family Tachinidae and the genus <i>Miltogramma</i>; it hangs about the neighbourhood of
  the nests, and sooner or later finds its opportunity of descending on the prey the <i>Bembex</i>
  is carrying, choosing for its purpose a moment when the <i>Bembex</i> makes a brief delay just at
  the mouth of the burrow; then down comes the <i>Miltogramma</i> and lays one, two, or three eggs
  on some portion of the booty that may be projecting from beneath the body of the wasp. This latter
  carries in the food for its own young, but thus introduces to the latter the source of its
  destruction, for the <i>Miltogramma</i> larvae eat up the supply of food intended for the
  <i>Bembex</i> larvae, and if there be not enough of this provender they satisfy their voracity by
  eating the <i>Bembex</i> larva itself. It is a remarkable fact that notwithstanding the presence
  of these strange larvae in the nest the mother <i>Bembex</i> continues to bring food at proper
  intervals, and, what is stranger still, makes no effort to rid the nest of the intruders:
  returning to the burrow with a supply of food she finds therein not only her legitimate offspring,
  a single tenant, but several others, strangers, it may be to the number of twelve; although she
  would have no difficulty in freeing the nest from this band of little brigands, she makes no
  attempt to do so, but continues to bring the <span class="pagenum" id="page122"><span
  class="smaller">{122}</span></span>supplies. In doing so she is fulfilling her duty; what matters
  it that she is nourishing the enemies of her race? Both race and enemies have existed for long,
  perhaps for untold periods of time, why then should she disturb herself, or deviate from her
  accustomed range of duties? Some of us will see in such proceedings only gross stupidity, while
  others may look on them as sublime toleration.</p>

  <p>The peculiar habits of <i>Bembex rostrata</i> are evidently closely connected with the fact
  that it actually kills, instead of merely paralysing, its prey; hence the frequent visits of
  supply are necessary that the larvae may have fresh, not putrefying, food; it may also be because
  of this that the burrow is made in a place of loose sand, so that rapid ingress may be possible to
  the <i>Bembex</i> itself, while the contents of the burrow are at the same time protected from the
  inroads of other creatures by the burrow being filled up with the light sand. Fabre informs us
  that the <i>Bembex</i> larva constructs a very remarkable cocoon in connection with the peculiar
  nature of the soil. The unprotected creature has to pass a long period in its cocoon, and the
  sandy, shifting soil renders it necessary that the protecting case shall be solid and capable of
  keeping its contents dry and sound. The larva, however, appears to have but a scanty supply of
  silk available for the purpose of constructing the cocoon, and therefore adopts the device of
  selecting grains of sand, and using the silk as a sort of cement to connect them together. For a
  full account of the ingenious way in which this difficult task is accomplished the reader should
  refer to the pages of Fabre himself. Bembecides appear to be specially fond of members of the
  Tabanidae (or Gad-fly family) as provender for their young. These flies infest mammals for the
  purpose of feasting on the blood they can draw by their bites, and the Bembecides do not hesitate
  to capture them while engaged in gratifying their blood-thirsty propensities. In North America a
  large species of Bembecid sometimes accompanies horsemen, and catches the flies that come to
  attack the horses; and Bates relates that on the Amazons a Bembecid as large as a hornet swooped
  down and captured one of the large blood-sucking Motuca flies that had settled on his neck. This
  naturalist has given an account of some of the Bembecides of the Amazons Valley, showing that the
  habits there are similar to those of their European congeners.</p>

  <p><i>Sphecius speciosus</i> is a member of the Stizinae, a group recognised by some as a distinct
  sub-family. It makes use, in North America, of Insects of the genus <i>Cicada</i> as food for its
  young. Burrows in the ground are made by the parent Insect; the egg is deposited on the
  <i>Cicada</i>, and the duration of the feeding-time of the larva is believed to be not more than a
  week; the pupa is contained in a silken cocoon, with which much earth is incorporated. Riley
  states that dry earth is essential to the well-being of this Insect, as the <i>Cicada</i> become
  mouldy if the earth is at all damp. As the <i>Cicada</i> is about twice as heavy as the
  <i>Sphecius</i> itself, this latter, when about to take the captured burden to the nest, adopts
  the plan of climbing with it to the top of a tree, or some similar point of vantage, so that
  during its flight it has to descend with its heavy burden instead of having to rise with it, as
  would be necessary if the start were made from the ground.</p>

    outer edge; hind body usually not pedicellate; wing with the marginal cell not
    appendiculate.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>This group has been but little studied, and there is not much knowledge as to the habits of the
  species. It is admitted to be impossible to define it accurately. It is by some entomologists
  considered to include <i>Mellinus</i>, in which the abdomen is pedicellate (Fig. 48), while others
  treat that genus as forming a distinct sub-family, Mellinides. Kohl leaves <i>Mellinus</i>
  unclassified. Gerstaecker has called attention to the fact that many of the Insects in this group
  have the trochanters of the hind and middle legs divided: the division is, as a rule, not so
  complete as it usually is in Hymenoptera Parasitica; but it is even more marked in some of these
  Nyssonides than it is in certain of the parasitic groups.</p>

  <p><i>Mellinus arvensis</i> is one of our commonest British Fossores, and we are indebted to the
  late F. Smith for the following account of its habits: "It preys upon flies, and may be commonly
  observed resorting to the droppings of cows in search of its prey; it is one of the most wary and
  talented of all its fraternity; were it at once to attempt, by a sudden leap, to dart upon its
  victim, ten to one it would fail to secure it; no, it does no such thing, it wanders about in a
  sort of innocent, unconcerned way, amongst <span class="pagenum" id="page124"><span
  class="smaller">{124}</span></span>the deluded flies, until a safe opportunity presents itself,
  when its prey is taken without any chance of failure; such is its ordinary mode of proceeding. At
  Bournemouth the flies are more active, more difficult to capture, or have they unmasked the
  treacherous <i>Mellinus?</i> and is it found necessary to adopt some fresh contrivance in order to
  accomplish its ends? if so, it is not deficient in devices. I noticed once or twice, what I took
  to be a dead specimen of <i>Mellinus</i>, lying on patches of cow-dung; but on attempting to pick
  them up off they flew; I at once suspected the creature, and had not long to wait before my
  suspicions were confirmed. Another, apparently dead fellow, was observed; and there, neither
  moving head or foot, the treacherous creature lay, until a fine specimen of a Bluebottle ventured
  within its grasp, when, active as any puss, the <i>Mellinus</i> started into life, and pounced
  upon its victim."</p>

  <p>Lucas states that in the north of France <i>Mellinus sabulosus</i> provisions its nest with
  Diptera, which it searches for on the flowers of Umbelliferae, and then carries to its nest. This
  is a burrow in the earth, and when it is reached the Hymenopteron deposits its Insect burden for a
  moment on the ground while it turns round in order to enter the burrow backwards. The same writer
  states that two varieties of this Insect live together&mdash;or rather in the same
  colonies&mdash;and make use of different species of Diptera, even of different genera, as food for
  their young. These Diptera are stung before being placed in the nest. The stinging does not kill
  the Insect, however, for Lucas was able to keep one specimen alive for six weeks after it had
  passed this trying ordeal.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This sub-family contains Insects resembling wasps or Crabronides in appearance, and is, as
  regards the pronotal structure, <span class="pagenum" id="page125"><span
  class="smaller">{125}</span></span>intermediate between the two great divisions of the Fossores,
  for the pronotal lobe extends nearly or quite as far back as the tegulae, and in <i>Philanthus</i>

  <p>The species of the genus <i>Cerceris</i> are numerous in Europe, and several of them are known
  to make burrows in the ground, and store them with beetles for the benefit of the future larvae.
  The beetles chosen differ in family according to the species of <i>Cerceris</i>; but it appears
  from the observations of Fabre and Dufour that one kind of <i>Cerceris</i> never in its selection
  goes out of the limits of a particular family of beetles, but, curiously enough, will take Insects
  most dissimilar in form and colour provided they belong to the proper family. This choice, so wide
  in one direction and so limited in another, seems to point to the existence of some sense, of the
  nature of which we are unaware, that determines the selection made by the Insect. In the case of
  our British species of <i>Cerceris</i>, Smith observed <i>C. arenaria</i> carrying to its nest
  Curculionidae of very diverse forms; while <i>C. labiata</i> used a beetle&mdash;<i>Haltica
  tabida</i>&mdash;of the family Chrysomelidae.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The beetles, after being caught, are stung in the chief articulation of the body, that, namely,
  between the pro- and mesothorax. <i>Cerceris bupresticida</i> confines itself exclusively to
  beetles of the family Buprestidae. It was by observations on this Insect that Dufour first
  discovered the fact that the Insects stored up do not decay: he thought, however, that this was
  due to the liquid injected by the wasp exercising some antiseptic power; but the observations of
  Fabre have shown that the preservation in a fresh state is due to life not being extinguished; the
  stillness, almost as if of death, being due to the destruction of the functional activity of the
  nerve centres that govern the movements of the limbs.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page126"><span class="smaller">{126}</span></span></div>

  <p>It has long been known that some species of <i>Cerceris</i> prey on bees of the genus
  <i>Halictus</i>, and Marchal has recently described in detail the proceedings of <i>C. ornata</i>.
  This Insect catches a <i>Halictus</i> on the wing, and, holding its neck with the mandibles, bends
  her body beneath it, and paralyses it by a sting administered at the front articulation of the
  neck. The <i>Halictus</i> is subsequently more completely stunned or bruised by a process of
  kneading by means of the mandibles of the <i>Cerceris</i>. Marchal attaches great importance to
  this "malaxation"; indeed, he is of opinion that it takes as great a part in producing or
  prolonging the paralysis as the stinging does. Whether the malaxation would be sufficient of
  itself to produce the paralysis he could not decide, for it appears to be impossible to induce the
  <i>Cerceris</i> to undertake the kneading until after it has reduced the <i>Halictus</i> to
  quietude by stinging.</p>

  <p>Fabre made some very interesting observations on <i>Cerceris tuberculata</i>, their object
  being to obtain some definite facts as to the power of these Insects to find their way home when
  removed to a distance. He captured twelve examples of the female, marked each individual on the
  thorax with a spot of white paint, placed it in a paper roll, and then put all the rolls, with
  their prisoners, in a box; in this they were removed to a distance of two kilometres from the home
  and then released. He visited the home five hours afterwards, and was speedily able to assure
  himself that at any rate four out of the twelve had returned to the spot from whence they had been
  transported, and he entertained no doubt that others he did not wait to capture had been equally
  successful in home-finding. He then commenced a second experiment by capturing nine examples,
  marking each with two spots on the thorax, and confining them in a dark box. They were then
  transported to the town of Carpentras, a distance of three kilometres, and released in the public
  street, "in the centre of a populous quarter," from their dark prison. Each <i>Cerceris</i> on
  being released rose vertically between the houses to a sufficient height, and then at once passed
  over the roofs in a southerly direction&mdash;the direction of home. After some hours he went back
  to the homes of the little wasps, but could not find that any of them had then returned; the next
  day he went again, and found that at any rate five of the <i>Cerceris</i> liberated the previous
  day were then at home. This record is of considerable <span class="pagenum" id="page127"><span
  class="smaller">{127}</span></span>interest owing to two facts, viz. that it is not considered
  that the <i>Cerceris</i> as a rule extends its range far from home, and that the specimens were
  liberated in a public street, and took the direction of home at once.</p>

  <p><i>Philanthus apivorus</i> is one of the best known of the members of this sub-family owing to
  its habit of using the domestic honey-bee as the food for its offspring. In many respects its
  habits resemble those of <i>Cerceris ornata</i>, except that the <i>Philanthus</i> apparently
  kills the bee at once, while in the case of the <i>Cerceris</i>, the <i>Halictus</i> it entombs
  does not perish for several days. The honey-bee, when attacked by the <i>Philanthus</i>, seems to
  be almost incapable of defending itself, for it appears to have no power of finding with its sting
  the weak places in the armour of its assailant. According to Fabre, it has no idea of the
  <i>Philanthus</i> being the enemy of its race, and associates with its destroyer on amicable terms
  previous to the attack being made on it. The <i>Philanthus</i> stings the bee on the under-surface
  of the mentum; afterwards the poor bee is subjected to a violent process of kneading, by which the
  honey is forced from it, and this the destroyer greedily imbibes. The bee is then carried to the
  nest of the <i>Philanthus</i>. This is a burrow in the ground; it is of unusual depth&mdash;about
  a yard according to Fabre&mdash;and at its termination are placed the cells for the reception of
  the young; in one of these cells the bee is placed, and an egg laid on it: as the food in this
  case is really dead, not merely in a state of an&aelig;sthesia, the <i>Philanthus</i> does not complete
  the store of food for its larvae all at once, but waits until the latter has consumed its first
  stock, and then the mother-wasp supplies a fresh store of food. In this case, therefore, as in
  <i>Bembex</i>, the mother really tends the offspring.</p>

  <p>The Pemphredonine subdivision includes numerous small and obscure Insects found chiefly in
  Europe and North America (Fig. 51, <i>P. lugubris</i>); they resemble the smaller black species of

  channel formed in the pithy stems of bushes. <i>Cemonus unicolor</i>, according to Giraud, forms
  its burrows in bramble-stems, but it also takes advantage, for the purposes of nidification, of
  the abandoned galls of <i>Cynips</i>, and also of a peculiar swelling formed by a
  fly&mdash;<i>Lipara lucens</i>&mdash;on the common reed, <i>Arundo phragmites</i>. This species

  <p>The Crabronides (<i>Vespa crabro</i>, the hornet, is not of this sub-family) are wasp-like

  they are specially attached to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, but this may
  possibly be in part due to their having escaped attention elsewhere. In Britain they form the most
  important part of the fossorial Hymenoptera, the genus <i>Crabro</i> (with numerous sub-genera)
  itself comprising thirty species. The males of some of the forms have the front tibiae and tarsi
  of most extraordinary shapes. They form burrows in dead wood, or in pithy stems, (occasionally in

  portions of old wood are broken from trees.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Oxybelus</i> is included by some systematists, but with doubt, in this sub-family;
  if not placed here, it must form a distinct sub-family. It has the metathorax spinose, and the
  sub-marginal and first discoidal cells are not, or are scarcely, separated.</p>

  <p><i>Crabro leucostomus</i> has been observed by Fletcher to form cells for its larvae in the
  soft wood of broken willows: the food stored therein consists of two-winged flies of the family
  Dolichopodidae. This <i>Crabro</i> is parasitised by an Ichneumonid of the genus <i>Tryphon</i>,
  and by a two-winged fly of uncertain genus, but belonging to the family Tachinidae. The
  metamorphoses of <i>Crabro chrysostomus</i> have been briefly described by Verhoeff: the food
  stored consists of Diptera, usually of the family <span class="pagenum" id="page130"><span
  class="smaller">{130}</span></span>Syrphidae; the larva spins an orange-red cocoon, passes the
  winter therein, and assumes the pupal form in the spring; there is, he says, a segment more in the
  female pupa than there is in the male.</p>

  <p>The species of the sub-genus <i>Crossocerus</i> provision their nests with Aphididae, but <i>C.
  wesmaeli</i> makes use, for the purpose, according to Ferton, of an elegant little fly of the
  family Tipulidae; according to Pissot this same wasp also makes use of a species of
  <i>Typhlocyba</i>, a genus of the Homopterous division of Rhynchota. Supposing there to be no
  mistake as to this latter observation, the choice of Diptera and of Homoptera by the same species
  indicates a very peculiar habit.</p>

  <p><i>Fertonius</i> (<i>Crossocerus</i>) <i>luteicollis</i> in Algeria forms cells at a slight
  depth in sandy soil, and provisions them with ants. The ant selected is <i>Tapinoma erraticum</i>,
  and the individuals captured are the wingless workers. The mode of hunting has been described by
  Ferton; the wasp hovers over one of the ant-paths at a distance of a few millimetres only above
  the surface, and when an ant that is considered suitable passes, the <i>Fertonius</i> pounces on
  it, stings it, and carries it off to the burrow; forty or fifty ants are accumulated in a cell,
  the egg is laid in the heap of victims about one-third of the depth from the bottom; the resulting
  larva sucks the ants one by one, by attaching itself to the thorax behind the first pair of legs.
  There is a very interesting point in connection with the habits of this species, viz. that the
  ants are not only alive, but lively; they have, however, lost the power of co-ordinating the
  movements of the limbs, and are thus unable to direct any attack against the feeble larva. Ferton
  thinks there are three generations of this species in a single year.</p>

    have mentioned the new publication of Mr. and Mrs. Peckham on the habits of Fossores. We may
    here add that it contains much fresh information on these Insects, together with criticisms of
    the views of Fabre and others. One of the points most noteworthy is that they have observed
    <i>Crabro stirpicola</i> working night and day for a period of forty-two consecutive hours. They
    made experiments on <i>Bembex spinolae</i> with a view of ascertaining whether the female
    provisions two nests simultaneously; as the result they think this improbable. If the female
    Bembecid make nests only consecutively, it is clear it must have but a small fecundity. The
    larval life extends over about fifteen days; and if we allow three months as the duration of
    life of a female, it is evident that only about six young can be produced in a season.</p>

  <p>In ants the distinction between the three great regions of the body is very marked. The abdomen
  is connected with the propodeum in a peculiar manner, one or two segments being detached from the
  main mass to form a very mobile articulation. This is the most distinctive of the characters of
  ants. The structure and form of these parts varies <span class="pagenum" id="page132"><span

  </div>

  <p>The arrangement of the parts of the mouth is remarkable, and results in leaving the mandibles
  quite free and unconnected with the other trophi; the mouth itself is, except during feeding,
  closed completely by the lower lip and maxilla assuming an ascending vertical direction, while the
  upper lip hangs down and overlaps the lower lip, being closely applied to it; so that in Ponerides
  the palpi, except the apices of the maxillary pair, are enclosed between the upper and lower lips
  (Fig. 54, A). In Cryptocerini the palpi are not covered by the closed lips, but are protected by
  being placed in chinks at the outsides of the parts closing the mouth. The mandibles of ants can
  thus be used in the freest manner without the other parts of the mouth being opened or even moved.
  The mandibles close transversely over the rest of the mouth, and when shut are very firmly locked.
  There are, however, some ants in which the lips remain in the position usual in mandibulate
  Insects.</p>

  <p>The antennae, except in the males of some species, have a long basal joint and are abruptly
  elbowed at its extremity. The eyes and ocelli vary excessively, and may be totally absent or very
  highly developed in the same species. The winged forms are, however, never blind. The size of the
  head varies extremely in the same species; it is frequently very small in the males, and largest
  in the workers. In some ants the worker-caste consists of large-headed and small-headed
  individuals; the former are called soldiers, and it has been supposed that some of them may act
  the part of superior officers to the others. It should be clearly understood that there is no
  definite distinction between soldiers and workers; so that in this respect they are widely
  different from Termites.</p>

  <p>The complex mass forming the thorax is subject to great change of structure in the same
  species, according as the individuals are winged or wingless. The sutures between the dorsal
  (notal) pieces are frequently obliterated in the workers, while they are distinct in the males and
  females, and the pieces themselves are also much larger in size in these sexed individuals. The
  pro-mesothoracic stigma is apparently always distinct; the meso-metathoracic one is distinct in
  the male <i>Dorylus</i>, but can scarcely be detected in the winged forms of other ants, owing to
  its being enclosed within, and covered by, the suture between the two segments: in the workers,
  however, it is usually quite conspicuous. The posterior part of the thoracic mass, the propodeum
  or median segment, is of considerable size; no transverse suture between the component pieces of
  this part can be seen, but its stigma is always very distinct. The peduncle, or pedicel, formed by
  the extremely mobile segment or segments at the base of the abdomen (already noticed as forming
  the most conspicuous character of the family), exhibits much variety.  Sometimes the first segment
  bears a plate or shield called a scale (Fig. 53, A, <i>b</i>); at other times there are two <span
  class="pagenum" id="page134"><span class="smaller">{134}</span></span>small segments (Fig. 53, B,
  C, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) forming nodes or knots, of almost any shape. The articulations between
  these segments are of the most perfect description. In many ants these parts bear highly developed
  stridulating organs, and the delicacy and perfection of the articulations allow the parts to be
  moved either with or without producing stridulation. In the male sex the peduncle and its nodes
  are much less perfect, and possess comparatively little capacity for movement; in the male of
  <i>Dorylus</i> (Figs. 79, A, and 80, <i>f</i>) the single node is only imperfectly formed. The
  eyes and ocelli of the males are usually more largely developed than they are in the female,
  though the head is much smaller.</p>

  <p>The legs of ants are elongate, except in a few forms; the Cryptocerini and the males of
  Dorylides being the most conspicuous exceptions. The tarsi are five-jointed, the basal joint being
  disproportionately elongate, so that in use it acts in many species as if it were a portion of the
  tibia, the other four joints forming the functional foot. The front tibiae are furnished with a
  beautiful combing apparatus (Fig. 57).</p>

  <p><b>Features of Ant-life.</b>&mdash;In order that the reader may realise the nature of ant-life
  we may briefly recount its more usual and general features. Numerous eggs are produced in a nest
  by one or more queens, and are taken care of by workers. These eggs hatch and produce helpless
  maggots, of which great care is taken by the workers. These nurses feed their charges from their
  own mouths, and keep the helpless creatures in a fitting state by transporting them to various
  chambers in conformity with changes of temperature, humidity, and so on. When full grown the
  maggots change to pupae. In some species the maggots form cocoons for themselves, but in others
  this is not the case, and the pupae are naked.<a id="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>
  After a brief period of <span class="pagenum" id="page135"><span
  class="smaller">{135}</span></span>pupal life a metamorphosis into the perfect Insect occurs. The
  creatures then disclosed may be either winged or wingless; the wingless are the workers and
  soldiers&mdash;imperfect females&mdash;the winged are males or females fully developed. The
  workers remain in or near the nest they were produced in, but the winged individuals rise into the
  air for a nuptial flight, often in great numbers, and couple. When this is accomplished the male
  speedily dies, but the females cast their wings and are ready to enter on a long life devoted to
  the production of eggs. From this account it will be gathered that males are only found in the
  nests for a very short time; the great communities consisting at other periods entirely of the two
  kinds of females and of young. The imperfect females are themselves in some species of various
  kinds; each kind being restricted, more or less completely, to a distinct kind of duty.</p>

  <p>No Insects are more familiar to us than ants; in warm countries some of them even invade the
  habitations of man, or establish their communities in immediate proximity to his dwellings. Their
  industry and pertinacity have, even in remote ages, attracted the attention and admiration of
  serious men; some of whom&mdash;we need scarcely mention Solomon as amongst them&mdash;have not
  hesitated to point out these little creatures as worthy of imitation by that most self-complacent
  of all the species of animals, <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>

  <p>Observation has revealed most remarkable phenomena in the lives of these Insects. Indeed, we
  can scarcely avoid the conclusion that they have acquired in many respects the art of living
  together in societies more perfectly than our own species has, and that they have anticipated us
  in the acquisition of some of the industries and arts that greatly facilitate social life. The
  lives of individual ants extend over a considerable number of years&mdash;in the case of certain
  species at any rate&mdash;so that the competence of the individual may be developed to a
  considerable extent by exercise; and one generation may communicate to a younger one by example
  the arts of living by which it has itself profited. The prolonged life of ants, their existence in
  the perfect state at all seasons, and the highly social life they lead are facts of the greatest
  biological importance, and are those that we should expect to be accompanied by greater and wider
  competence than is usually exhibited <span class="pagenum" id="page136"><span
  class="smaller">{136}</span></span>by Insects. There can indeed be little doubt that ants are
  really not only the "highest" structurally or mechanically of all Insects, but also the most
  efficient. There is an American saying to the effect that the ant is the ruler of Brazil. We must
  add a word of qualification; the competence of the ant is not like that of man. It is devoted to
  the welfare of the species rather than to that of the individual, which is, as it were, sacrificed
  or specialised for the benefit of the community. The distinctions between the sexes in their
  powers or capacities are astonishing, and those between the various forms of one sex are also
  great. The difference between different species is extreme; we have, in fact, the most imperfect
  forms of social evolution coexisting, even locally, with the most evolute.</p>

  <p>These facts render it extremely difficult for us to appreciate the ant; the limitations of
  efficiency displayed by the individual being in some cases extreme, while observation seems to
  elicit contradictory facts. About two thousand species are already known, and it is pretty certain
  that the number will reach at least five thousand. Before passing to the consideration of a
  selection from what has been ascertained as to the varieties of form and of habits of ants we will
  deal briefly with their habitations and polymorphism, reserving some remarks as to their
  associations with other Insects to the conclusion of this chapter.</p>

  <p><b>Nests.</b>&mdash;Ants differ greatly from the other Social Hymenoptera in the nature of
  their habitations. The social bees construct cells of wax crowded together in large numbers, and
  the wasps do the like with paper; the eggs and young being placed, each one in a separate cell,
  the combinations of which form a comb. Ants have, however, a totally different system; no comb is
  constructed, and the larvae are not placed in cells, but are kept in masses and are moved about
  from place to place as the necessities of temperature, air, humidity and other requirements
  prompt. The habitations of ants are in all cases irregular chambers, of which there is often a
  multiplicity connected by galleries, and they sometimes form a large system extending over a
  considerable area. Thus the habitations of ants are more like those of the Termites than those of
  their own allies among the Hymenoptera. They are chiefly remarkable for their great variety, and
  for the skilful manner in which they are adapted by their little artificers to particular
  conditions. The most usual form in Europe, is a <span class="pagenum" id="page137"><span
  class="smaller">{137}</span></span>number of subterranean chambers, often under the shelter of a
  stone, and connected by galleries. It is of course very difficult to trace exactly the details of
  such a work, because when excavations are made for the purposes of examination, the construction
  becomes destroyed; it is known, however, that some of these systems extend to a considerable depth
  in the earth, it is said to as much as nine feet, and it is thought the object of this is to have
  access to sufficiently moist earth, for ants are most sensitive to variations in the amount of
  moisture; a quite dry atmosphere is in the case of many species very speedily fatal. This system
  of underground labyrinths is sometimes accompanied by above-ground buildings consisting of earth
  more or less firmly cemented together by the ants; this sort of dwelling is most frequently
  adopted when the soil in which the nests are placed is sandy; it is probable that the earth is in
  such cases fastened together by means of a cement produced by the salivary glands of the ants, but
  this has not been determined with certainty; vaulted galleries or tunnels of this kind are
  constructed by many species of ants in order to enable them to approach desired objects.</p>

  <p>In South America <i>Camponotus rufipes</i> and other species that habitually dwell in stumps,
  in certain districts where they are liable to inundations, build also nests of a different nature
  on trees for refuge during the floods. In Europe, a little robber-ant, <i>Solenopsis fugax</i>,
  constructs its dwelling in combination with that of <i>Formica fusca</i> (Fig. 58), in such a
  manner that its chambers cannot, on account of the small size of the orifices, be entered by the
  much larger <i>Formica</i>. Hence the robber obtains an easy living at the expense of the larger
  species. The Sauba or Sauva ants of South America (the genus <i>Atta</i> of some, <i>Oecodoma</i>
  of other authors) appear to be most proficient in the art of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page138"><span class="smaller">{138}</span></span>subterranean mining. Their systems of
  tunnels and nests are known to extend through many square yards of earth, and it is said on the
  authority of Hamlet Clark that one species tunnelled under the bed of the river Parahyba at a spot
  where it was as broad as the Thames at London Bridge.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of ants, instead of mining in the ground, form chambers in wood; these
  are usually very close to one another, because, the space being limited, galleries cannot be
  indulged in. <i>Camponotus ligniperdus</i> in Europe, and <i>C. pennsylvanicus</i> in North
  America, work in this way.</p>

  <p>Our British <i>Lasius fuliginosus</i> lives in decayed wood. Its chambers are said by Forel to
  consist of a paper-like substance made from small fragments of wood. <i>Cryptocerus</i> burrows in
  branches. <i>Colobopsis</i> lives in a similar manner, and Forel informs us that a worker with a
  large head is kept stationed within the entrance, its great head acting as a stopper; when it sees
  a nest-fellow desirous of entering the nest, this animated and intelligent front-door then
  retreats a little so as to make room for ingress of the friend. Forel has observed that in the
  tropics of America a large number of species of ants live in the stems of grass. There is also
  quite a fauna of ants dwelling in hollow thorns, in spines, on trees or bushes, or in dried parts
  of pithy plants; and the tropics also furnish a number of species that make nests of delicate
  paper, or that spin together by means of silk the leaves of trees. One eastern
  species&mdash;<i>Polyrhachis spinigera</i>&mdash;fabricates a gauze-like web of silk, with which
  it lines a subterranean chamber after the manner of a trap-door spider.</p>

  <p>Some species of ants appear to find both food and shelter <span class="pagenum"
  id="page139"><span class="smaller">{139}</span></span>entirely on the tree they inhabit, the food
  being usually sweet stuff secreted by glands of the plant. It is thought that the ants in return
  are of considerable benefit to the plant by defending it from various small enemies, and this kind
  of symbiosis has received much attention from naturalists. A very curious condition exists in the
  epiphytic plants of the genera <i>Myrmecodia</i> and <i>Hydnophytum</i>; these plants form large
  bulb-like (Fig. 59) excrescences which, when cut into, are found to be divided into chambers quite
  similar to those frequently made by ants. Though these structures are usually actually inhabited
  by ants, it appears that they are really produced by the plant independent of the Insects.</p>

  <p><b>Variability and Polymorphism of Ants.</b>&mdash;Throughout the Hymenoptera there are
  scattered cases in which one of the sexes appears in dimorphic form. In the social kinds of bees
  and wasps the female sex exists in two conditions, a reproductive one called queen, and an
  infertile one called worker, the limits between the two forms seeming in some cases (honey-bee) to
  be absolute as regards certain structures. This sharp distinction in structure is rare; while as
  regards fertility intermediate conditions are numerous, and may indeed be induced by changing the
  social state of a community.<a id="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> In ants the phenomena
  of the kind we are alluding to are very much more complex. There are no solitary ants;
  associations are the rule (we shall see there are one or two cases in which the association is
  with individuals of other species). In correlation with great proclivity to socialism we find an
  extraordinary increase in the variety of the forms of which species are made up. In addition to
  the male and female individuals of which the species of Insects usually consist, there are in ants
  workers of various kinds, and soldiers, all of which are modified infertile females. But in
  addition to the existence of these castes of infertile females, we find also numerous cases of
  variability or of dimorphism of the sexual individuals; and this in both sexes, though more
  usually in the female. Thus there exists in ants an extraordinary variety in the polymorphism of
  forms, as shown by the table on p. 141, where several very peculiar conditions are recorded.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The complex nature of these phenomena has only recently <span class="pagenum"
  id="page140"><span class="smaller">{140}</span></span>become known, and as yet has been but little
  inquired into. The difference between the thoracic structure in the case of the winged and
  wingless females of certain species (Fig. 55, and in vol. v. fig. 339) is enormous, but in other
  species this difference appears to be much less. The ordinary distinctions between the
  queen-female and worker-females appear to be of two kinds; firstly, that the former is winged, the
  latter wingless;<a id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> and secondly, that the former
  possesses a <i>receptaculum seminis</i>, the latter does not. In a few cases it would seem that
  the dimorphism of winged and wingless forms is not complete, but that variability exists.
  Intermediate conditions between the winged and wingless forms are necessarily rare; nevertheless a
  certain number have already been detected, and specimens of <i>Lasius alienus</i> have been found
  with short wings. In rather numerous species some or all of the fertile females depart from the
  usual state and have no wings; (a similar condition is seen, it will be recollected, in Mutillides
  and Thynnides of the neighbouring family Scoliidae). A dimorphism as regards wings also exists in
  the male sex, though it is only extremely rarely in ants that the males are wingless. Neverless a
  few species exist of which only wingless males have been found, and a few others in which both
  winged and wingless individuals of this sex are known to occur. The wingless males of course
  approach the ordinary workers (= infertile wingless females) in appearance, but there is not at
  present any reason for supposing that they show any diminution in their male sexual characters.
  The distinction between workers and females as based on the existence or non-existence of a
  <i>receptaculum seminis</i> has only recently become known, and its importance cannot yet be
  estimated. The adult, sexually capable, though wingless forms, are called ergatoid, because they
  are similar to workers (<span title="Ergat&ecirc;s" class="fsn">&#x1F18;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>,

  <p>In addition to the above there are apparently cases of females with post-metamorphic growth in
  Dorylides, but these have not yet been the subject of investigation.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page142"><span class="smaller">{142}</span></span></div>

  <p>Much has been written about the mode in which the variety of forms of a single species of ant
  is produced. As to this there exists but little actual observation or experiment, and the subject
  has been much complicated by the anxiety of the writers to display the facts in a manner that will
  support some general theory. Dewitz was of opinion that workers and queens of ants were produced
  from different kinds of eggs. This view finds but little support among recent writers. Hart in
  recording the results of his observations on the parasol ant (of the genus <i>Atta</i>)&mdash;one
  of the species in which polymorphism is greatest&mdash;says<a id="NtA_58"
  href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> that these observations prove that "ants can manufacture at
  will, male, female, soldier, worker or nurse," but he has not determined the method of production,
  and he doubts it being "the character of the food." There is, however, a considerable body of
  evidence suggesting that the quality or quantity of the food, or both combined, are important
  factors in the treatment by which the differences are produced. The fact that the social Insects
  in which the phenomena of caste or polymorphism occur, though belonging to very diverse groups,
  all feed their young, is of itself very suggestive. When we add to this the fact that in ants,
  where the phenomena of polymorphism reach their highest complexity, the food is elaborated in
  their own organs by the feeders that administer it, it appears probable that the means of
  producing the diversity may be found herein. Wasmann has pointed out that the ants'-nest beetle,
  <i>Lomechusa</i>, takes much food from the ants, and itself destroys their young, and that in
  nests where <i>Lomechusa</i> is abundant a large percentage of ergatogynous forms of the ants are
  produced. He attributes this to the fact that the destruction of the larvae of the ant by the
  beetle brings into play the instinct of the ants, which seek to atone for the destruction by
  endeavouring to produce an increased number of fertile forms; many ergatogynous individuals being
  the result. This may or may not be the case, but it is clear that the ants' instinct cannot
  operate without some material means, and his observation adds to the probability that this means
  is the food supply, modified either qualitatively or quantitatively.</p>

  <p>The existence of these polymorphic forms led Herbert Spencer to argue that the form of an
  animal is not absolutely <span class="pagenum" id="page143"><span
  class="smaller">{143}</span></span>determined by those "Anlagen" or rudiments that Weismann and
  his school consider to be all important in determining the nature or form of the individual, for
  if this were the case, how can it be, he asked, that one egg may produce either a worker, nurse,
  soldier or female ant? To this Wasmann (who continued the discussion) replied by postulating the
  existence of double, triple or numerous rudiments in each egg, the treatment the egg receives
  merely determining which of these rudiments shall undergo development.<a id="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> Forel seems to have adopted this explanation as being the most
  simple. The probability of Weismann's hypothesis being correct is much diminished by the fact that
  the limit between the castes is by no means absolute. In many species intermediate forms are
  common, and even in those in which the castes are believed to be quite distinct, intermediate
  forms occur as very rare exceptions.<a id="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Emery
  accounts<a id="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> for the polymorphism, without the
  assistance of the Weismannian hypothetical compound rudiments, by another set of assumptions; viz.
  that the phenomenon has been gradually acquired by numerous species, and that we see it in various
  stages of development; also that variation in nutrition does not affect all the parts of the body
  equally, but may be such as to carry on the development of certain portions of the organisation
  while that of other parts is arrested. Speaking broadly we may accept this view as consistent with
  what we know to be the case in other Insects, and with the phenomena of post-embryonic development
  in the class. But it must be admitted that our knowledge is at present quite inadequate to justify
  the formulation of any final conclusions.</p>

  <p>The geological record of Formicidae is not quite what we should have expected. They are amongst
  the earliest Hymenoptera; remains referred to the family have been found in the Lias of
  Switzerland and in the English Purbecks. In Tertiary times Formicidae appear to have been about
  the most abundant of all Insects. At Florissant they occur in thousands and form in individuals
  about one-fourth of all the Insects found there. They have also been met with numerously in the
  European Tertiaries, and Mayr studied no less than 1500 specimens found <span class="pagenum"
  id="page144"><span class="smaller">{144}</span></span>in amber. Formicides and Myrmicides are more
  abundant than Ponerides, but this latter group has the larger proportion of extinct genera;
  conditions but little dissimilar to those existing at present.</p>

  <p><b>Classification of Ants.</b>&mdash;Ants are considered by many entomologists to form a series
  called Heterogyna. They can, however, be scarcely considered as more than a single family,
  Formicidae, so that the serial name is superfluous. Their nearest approach to other Aculeates is
  apparently made, by <i>Amblyopone</i>, to certain Mutillides (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Apterogyna</i>) and
  to the Thynnides, two divisions of Scoliidae. Emery considers Dorylides rather than Amblyoponides
  to be the most primitive form of ants, but we are disposed to consider Forel's view to the effect
  we have above mentioned as more probably correct. The point is, however, very doubtful. The
  condition of the peduncle is in both the sub-families we have mentioned very imperfect compared
  with that of other ants. Both these sub-families are of very small extent and very imperfectly
  known. We shall also follow Forel in adopting six sub-families, Camponotides, Dolichoderides,
  Myrmicides, Ponerides, Dorylides, and Amblyoponides. Emery rejects the Amblyoponides as being
  merely a division of the Ponerides. This latter group displays the widest relations of all the
  sub-families, and may be looked on as a sort of central form. The Camponotides and Dolichoderides
  are closely allied, and represent the highest differentiation of the families in one direction.
  The Myrmicides are also highly differentiated, but are not allied to the Camponotides and
  Dolichoderides.<a id="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Camponotides.</b>&mdash;<i>Hind body furnished with but one
    constriction, so that only a single scale or node exists on the pedicel. Poison-sac forming a
    cushion of convolutions, on which is situate the modified sting, which forms merely an
    ejaculatory orifice for the poison.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The members of this very extensive division of ants can be readily distinguished from all
  others, except the Dolichoderides, by the absence of a true sting, and by the peculiar form of the
  hind body; this possesses only a single scale at the base, and has no <span class="pagenum"
  id="page145"><span class="smaller">{145}</span></span>constriction at all on the oval, convex and
  compact mass of the abdomen behind this. The cloacal orifice is circular, not, as in other ants,
  transverse. These characters are accompanied by a difference in habits. The Camponotides, though
  they do not sting, produce poison in large quantity, and eject it to some distance. Hence, if two
  specimens are confined in a tube they are apt to kill one another by the random discharges they
  make. Janet suggests that in order to neutralise the effect of this very acid poison, they may
  have some means of using, when they are in their natural abodes, the alkaline contents of a second
  gland with which they are provided. We shall mention the characters by which the Camponotides are
  distinguished from the small sub-family Dolichoderides when we deal with the latter.</p>

  <p>The sub-family includes 800 or more species. <i>Camponotus</i> itself is one of the most
  numerous in species of all the genera of Formicidae, and is distributed over most parts of the
  earth. We have no species of it in Britain, but in the south of Europe the <i>Camponotus</i>
  become very conspicuous, and may be seen almost everywhere stalking about, after the fashion of
  our British wood-ant, <i>Formica rufa</i>, which in general appearance <i>Camponotus</i> much
  resembles.</p>

  <p>Until recently, the manner in which fresh nests of ants were founded was unknown. In
  established nests the queen-ant is fed and tended by the workers, and the care of the helpless
  larvae and pupae also devolves entirely on the workers, so that the queens are relieved of all
  functions except that of producing eggs. It seemed therefore impossible that a fresh nest could be
  established by a single female ant unless she were assisted by workers. The mode in which nests
  are founded has, however, been recently demonstrated by the observations of Lubbock, M&lsquo;Cook,
  Adlerz, and more particularly by those of Blochmann, who was successful in observing the formation
  of new nests by <i>Camponotus ligniperdus</i> at Heidelberg. He found under stones in the spring
  many examples of females, either solitary or accompanied only by a few eggs, larvae or pupae.
  Further, he was successful in getting isolated females to commence nesting in confinement, and
  observed that the ant that afterwards becomes the queen, at first carries out by herself all the
  duties of the nest: beginning by making a small burrow, she lays some eggs, and when these hatch,
  feeds and tends the larvae and pupae; the first specimens of these <span class="pagenum"
  id="page146"><span class="smaller">{146}</span></span>latter that become perfect Insects are
  workers of all sizes, and at once undertake the duties of tending the young and feeding the
  mother, who, being thus freed from the duties of nursing and of providing food while she is
  herself tended and fed, becomes a true queen-ant. Thus it seems established that in the case of
  this species the division of labour found in the complex community, does not at first exist, but
  is correlative with increasing numbers of the society. Further observations as to the growth of
  one of these nascent communities, and the times and conditions under which the various forms of
  individuals composing a complete society first appear, would be of considerable interest.</p>

  <p>An American species of the same genus, <i>C. pennsylvanicus</i>, the carpenter-ant, establishes
  its nests in the stumps of trees. Leidy observed that solitary females constructed for themselves
  cells in the wood and closed the entrances, and that each one in its solitary confinement reared a
  small brood of larvae. The first young produced in this case are said to be of the dwarf caste,
  and it was thought by the observer that the ant remained not only without assistance but also
  without food during a period of some weeks, and this although she was herself giving food to the
  larvae she was rearing.</p>

  <p>Adlerz states that the females or young queens take no food while engaged in doing their early
  work, and that the large quantity of fat-body they possess enables them to undergo several months
  of hunger. In order to feed the young larvae they use their own eggs or even the younger larvae.
  It is to the small quantity of food rather than to its nature that he attributes the small size of
  the first brood of perfect workers. M. Janet<a id="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> has
  recently designed an ingenious and simple apparatus for keeping ants in captivity. In one of these
  he placed a solitary female of <i>Lasius alienus</i>, unaccompanied by any workers or other
  assistants, and he found at the end of 98 days that she was taking care of a progeny consisting of
  50 eggs, 2 larvae, 5 pupae in cocoons, 5 without cocoons. On the 102nd day workers began to emerge
  from the cocoons.<a id="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> From these observations it is
  evident that the queen-ant, when she begins her nest, lives under conditions extremely different
  from those of the royal state she afterwards reaches.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page147"><span class="smaller">{147}</span></span></div>

  <p>In many kinds of ants the full-grown individuals are known to feed not only the larvae by
  disgorging food from their own mouths into those of the little grubs, but also to feed one
  another. This has been repeatedly observed, and Forel made the fact the subject of experiment in
  the case of <i>Camponotus ligniperdus</i>. He took some specimens and shut them up without food
  for several days, and thereafter supplied some of them with honey, stained with Prussian blue;
  being very hungry, they fed so greedily on this that in a few hours their hind bodies were
  distended to three times their previous size. He then took one of these gorged individuals and
  placed it amongst those that had not been fed. The replete ant was at once explored by the touches
  of the other ants and surrounded, and food was begged from it. It responded to the demands by
  feeding copiously a small specimen from its mouth: when this little one had received a good
  supply, it in turn communicated some thereof to other specimens, while the original well-fed one
  also supplied others, and thus the food was speedily distributed. This habit of receiving and
  giving food is of the greatest importance in the life-history of ants, and appears to be the basis
  of some of the associations that, as we shall subsequently see, are formed with ants by numerous
  other Insects.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Oecophylla smaragdina</i>, a common ant in Eastern Asia, forms shelters on the leaves of
  trees by curling the edges of leaves and joining them together. In doing this it makes use of an
  expedient that would not be believed had it not been testified by several competent and
  independent witnesses. The perfect ant has no material with which to fasten together the edges it
  curls; its larva, however, possesses glands that secrete a supply of material for it to form a
  cocoon with, and the ants utilise the larvae to effect their purpose. Several of them combine to
  hold the foliage in the desired position, and while they do so, other ants come up, each one of
  which carries a larva in its jaws, applies the mouth of the larva to the parts where the cement is
  required, and makes it disgorge the sticky <span class="pagenum" id="page148"><span
  class="smaller">{148}</span></span>material. Our figure is taken from a specimen (for which we are
  indebted to Mr. E. E. Green) that was captured in the act of bearing a larva.</p>

  <p><i>Formica rufa</i>, the Red-ant, Wood-ant, or Hill-ant, is in this country one of the
  best-known members of the Formicidae. It frequents woods, especially such as are composed, in
  whole or part, of conifers, where it forms large mounds of small sticks, straws, portions of
  leaves, and similar material. Although at first sight such a nest may appear to be a chaotic
  agglomeration, yet examination reveals that it is arranged so as to leave many spaces, and is
  penetrated by galleries ramifying throughout its structure. These mound-nests attain a
  considerable size when the operations of the industrious creatures are not interfered with, or
  their work destroyed, as it too often is, by ignorant or mischievous persons. They may reach a
  height of three feet or near it, and a diameter of twice that extent. The galleries by which the
  heaps are penetrated lead down to the earth below. From the mounds extend in various directions
  paths constantly traversed by the indefatigable ants. M&lsquo;Cook observed such paths in the
  Trossachs; they proceed towards the objects aimed at in lines so straight that he considers they
  must be the result of some sense of direction possessed by the ants; as it is impossible to
  suppose they could perceive by the sense of sight the distant objects towards which the paths were
  directed: these objects in the case M&lsquo;Cook describes were oak-trees up which the ants
  ascended in search of Aphides.</p>

  <p>M&lsquo;Cook further observed that one of the oak-trees was reached by individuals from another
  nest, and that each of the two parties was limited to its own side of the tree, sentinels being
  placed on the limits to prevent the trespassing of an intruder; he also noticed that the ants saw
  an object when the distance became reduced to about an inch and a half from them. This species is
  considered to be wanting in individual courage; but when acting in combination of vast numbers it
  does so with intelligence and success. It does not make slaves, but it has been observed by
  Bignell and others that it sometimes recruits its numbers by kidnapping individuals from other
  colonies of its own species. Its nests are inhabited by forty or fifty species of guests of
  various kinds, but chiefly Insects. Another ant, <i>Myrmica laevinodis</i>, sometimes lives with
  it in perfect harmony, and <i>Formicoxenus <span class="pagenum" id="page149"><span
  class="smaller">{149}</span></span>nitidulus</i> lives only with <i>F. rufa</i>. Amongst the most
  peculiar of its dependants we may mention large beetles of the genera <i>Cetonia</i> and
  <i>Clythra</i>, which in their larval state live in the hills of the wood-ant. It is probable that
  they subsist on some of the vegetable matter of which the mounds are formed. Adlerz has given some
  attention to the division of labour amongst the different forms of the workers of ants, and says
  that in <i>F. rufa</i> it is only the bigger workers that carry building and other materials, the
  smaller individuals being specially occupied in the discovery of honey-dew and other Aphid
  products. In <i>Camponotus</i> it would appear, on the other hand, that the big individuals leave
  the heavy work to be performed by their smaller fellows.</p>

  <p>The wood-ant and its near allies have been, and indeed still are, a source of great difficulty
  to systematists on account of the variation that occurs in the same species, and because this
  differs according to locality. Our European <i>F. rufa</i> has been supposed to inhabit North
  America, and the interesting accounts published by M&lsquo;Cook of the mound-making ant of the
  Alleghanies were considered to refer to it. This Insect, however, is not <i>F. rufa</i>, as was
  supposed by M&lsquo;Cook, but <i>F. exsectoides</i>, Forel. It forms colonies of enormous extent,
  and including an almost incredible number of individuals. In one district of about fifty acres
  there was an Ant City containing no less than 1700 of these large ant-hills, each one teeming with
  life. It was found by transferring ants from one hill to another that no hostility whatever
  existed between the denizens of different hills; the specimens placed on a strange hill entered it
  without the least hesitation. Its habits differ in some particulars from those of its European
  congener; the North American Insect does not close the formicary at night, and the inquilines
  found in its nest are very different from those that live with <i>F. rufa</i> in Europe. Whether
  the typical wood-ant occurs in North America is doubtful, but there are races there that doubtless
  belong to the species.</p>

  <p><i>F. sanguinea</i> is very similar in appearance to its commoner congener <i>F. rufa</i>, and
  is the only slave-making ant we possess in Britain. This species constructs its galleries in
  banks, and is of very courageous character, carrying out its military operations with much
  tactical ability. It is perfectly able to live without the assistance of slaves, and very
  frequently does so; indeed it <span class="pagenum" id="page150"><span
  class="smaller">{150}</span></span>has been asserted that it is in our own islands (where,
  however, it is comparatively rare) less of a slave-owner than it is in Southern Europe, but this
  conclusion is very doubtful. It appears when fighting to be rather desirous of conquering its
  opponents by inspiring terror and making them aware of its superiority than by killing them;
  having gained a victory it will carry off the pupae from the nest it has conquered to its own
  abode, and the ants of the stranger-species that develop from these pupae serve the conquerors
  faithfully, and relieve them of much of their domestic duties. The species that <i>F.
  sanguinea</i> utilises in this way in England are <i>F. fusca</i>, <i>F. cunicularia</i>, and
  possibly <i>Lasius flavus</i>. Huber and Forel have given graphic accounts of the expeditions of
  this soldier-ant. In the mixed colonies of <i>F. sanguinea</i> and <i>F. fusca</i> the slaves do
  most of the house-work, and are more skilful at it than their masters. Adlerz says that one of the
  slaves will accomplish twice as much work of excavation in the same time as the slave-owner; these
  latter being lazy and fond of enjoyment, while the slaves are very industrious.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Fig. 61&mdash;Head of <i>Polyergus rufescens</i>. (After Andr&eacute;.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Polyergus rufescens</i>, an European ant allied to <i>Formica</i>, is renowned since the
  time of Huber (1810) as the slave-making or Amazon ant. This creature is absolutely dependent on
  its auxiliaries for its existence, and will starve, it is said, in the midst of food unless its
  servitors are there to feed it. Wasmann, however, states that <i>Polyergus</i> does possess the
  power of feeding itself to a certain extent. Be this as it may, the qualities of this ant as
  warrior are superb. When an individual is fighting alone its audacity is splendid, and it will
  yield to no superiority of numbers; when the creatures are acting as part of an army the
  individual boldness gives place to courage of a more suitable sort, the ants then exhibiting the
  act of retreating or making flank movements when necessary. If a <i>Polyergus</i> that is acting
  as a member of a troop finds itself isolated, and in danger of being overpowered, it has then no
  hesitation in seeking safety even by flight. This species is provided with mandibles of a peculiar
  nature; they are not armed with teeth, <span class="pagenum" id="page151"><span
  class="smaller">{151}</span></span>but are pointed and curved; they are therefore used after the
  manner of poignards, and when the ant attacks a foe it seizes the head between the points of these
  curved mandibles, and driving them with great force into the brain instantly paralyses the
  victim.</p>

  <p>Mandibles of this shape are evidently unfitted for the purposes of general work, they can
  neither cut, crush, nor saw, and it is not impossible that in their peculiar shape is to be found
  the origin of the peculiar life of <i>Polyergus</i>: we find similar mandibles reappearing amongst
  the aberrant Dorylides, and attaining a maximum of development in the ferocious <i>Eciton</i>;
  they also occur, or something like them, in a few aberrant Myrmicides; and in the male sex of many
  other ants, which sex exercises no industrial arts, this sort of mandible is present.</p>

  <p>The ants that <i>Polyergus</i> usually attacks in order to procure slaves are <i>Formica
  fusca</i> and <i>F. fusca</i>, race <i>auricularia</i>; after it has routed a colony of one of
  these species, <i>P. rufescens</i> pillages the nest and carries off pupae and some of the larger
  larvae to its own abode. When the captives thus deported assume the imago state, they are said to
  commence working just as if they were in their own houses among their brothers and sisters, and
  they tend their captors as faithfully as if these were their own relatives: possibly they do not
  recognise that they are in unnatural conditions, and may be quite as happy as if they had never
  been enslaved. The servitors are by no means deficient in courage, and if the place of their
  enforced abode should be attacked by other ant-enemies they defend it bravely. The fact that <i>P.
  rufescens</i> does not feed its larvae has been considered evidence of moral degeneration, but it
  is quite possible that the Insect may be unable to do so on account of some deficiency in the
  mouth-parts, or other similar cause. The larvae of ants are fed by nutriment regurgitated from the
  crop of a worker (or female), and applied to the excessively minute mouth of the helpless grub:
  for so delicate a process to be successfully accomplished, it is evident that a highly elaborated
  and specialised arrangement of the mouth-parts must exist, and it is by no means improbable that
  the capacity of feeding its young in true ant-fashion is absent in <i>Polyergus</i> for purely
  mechanical reasons.</p>

  <p>M&lsquo;Cook states that the North American ant, <i>Polyergus lucidus</i>, which some
  entomologists consider to be merely a variety of <span class="pagenum" id="page152"><span
  class="smaller">{152}</span></span>the European species, makes slaves of <i>Formica
  schaufussi</i>, itself does no work, and partakes of food only when fed by its servitors. He did
  not, however, actually witness the process of feeding. When a migration takes place the servitors
  deport both the males and females of <i>P. lucidus</i>. M&lsquo;Cook adds that the servitors
  appear to be really mistresses of the situation, though they avail themselves of their power only
  by working for the advantage of the other species.</p>

  <p>The honey-ant of the United States and Mexico has been investigated by M&lsquo;Cook and others;
  the chief peculiarity of the species is that certain individuals are charged with a sort of honey
  till they become enormously distended, and in fact serve as leather bottles for the storage of the
  fluid. The species <i>Myrmecocystus hortideorum</i> and <i>M. melliger</i>, are moderate-sized
  Insects of subterranean habits, the entrance to the nest of <i>M. hortideorum</i> being placed in
  a small raised mound. The honey is the product of a small gall found on oak leaves, and is
  obtained by the worker-ants during nocturnal expeditions, from which they return much distended;
  they feed such workers left at home as may be hungry, and then apparently communicate the
  remainder of the sweet stuff they have brought back to already partly charged "honey-bearers" left
  in the nest. The details of the process have not been observed, but the result is that the
  abdomens of the bearers become distended to an enormous extent (Figs. 62, 63), and the creatures
  move but little, and remain suspended to the roof of a special chamber. It is considered by
  M&lsquo;Cook that these living honey-tubs preserve the food till a time when it is required for
  the purposes of feeding the community. The distension is produced entirely by the overcharging of
  the honey-crop, the other contents of the abdomen being <span class="pagenum" id="page153"><span
  class="smaller">{153}</span></span>forced by the distention to the posterior part of the body.
  Lubbock has since described an Australian ant, <i>Melophorus inflatus</i>, having a similar
  peculiar habit, but belonging to the allied tribe Plagiolepisii. Quite recently a South African
  honey-tub ant belonging to the distinct genus <i>Plagiolepis</i> (<i>Ptrimeni</i> For.) has been
  discovered, affording a proof that an extremely specialised habit may arise independently of
  relation between the Insects, and in very different parts of the world.</p>

  <p>Species of the genus <i>Lasius</i> are amongst the most abundant of the ant-tribe in Britain.
  They are remarkable for their constructive powers. <i>L. niger</i>, the common little black
  garden-ant, forms extensive subterranean galleries, and is extremely successful in the cultivation
  of various forms of Aphidae, from the products of which the species derives a large part of its
  subsistence. The ants even transport the Aphidae to suitable situations, and thus increase their
  stock of this sugary kind of cattle, and are said to take the eggs into their own dwellings in the
  autumn so that these minute and fragile objects may be kept safe from the storms and rigours of
  winter. These little creatures are brave, but when attacked by other ants they defend themselves
  chiefly by staying in their extensive subterranean galleries, and blocking up and securing these
  against their assailants.</p>

  <p><i>L. fuliginosus</i>, another of our British species, has very different habits, preferring
  old trees and stumps for its habitation; in the hollows of these it forms dwellings of a sort of
  card; this it makes from the mixture of the secretions of its salivary glands with comminuted
  fragments of wood, after the fashion of wasps. It is a moderate-sized ant, much larger than the
  little <i>L. niger</i>, and is of a black colour and remarkably shining; it gives off a very
  strong but by no means disagreeable odour, and may be seen on the hollow trees it frequents,
  stalking about in large numbers in a slow and aimless manner that contrasts strikingly with the
  active, bustling movements of so many of its congeners. When this species finds suitable trees
  near one another, a colony is established in each; the number of individuals thus associated
  becomes very large, and as the different colonies keep up intercommunication, this habit is very
  useful for purposes of defence. Forel relates that he once brought a very large number of
  <i>Formica pratensis</i> and liberated them at the base of a tree in which was a nest of <i>L.
  fuliginosus</i>; these latter, finding <span class="pagenum" id="page154"><span
  class="smaller">{154}</span></span>themselves thus assaulted and besieged, communicated in some
  way, information of the fact to the neighbouring colonies, and Forel soon saw large columns of the
  black creatures issuing from the trees near by and coming with their measured paces to the
  assistance of their <i>confr&egrave;res</i>, so that the invaders were soon discomfited and destroyed.
  Although the European and North American representatives of the sub-family Camponotides live
  together in assemblies comprising as a rule a great number of individuals, and although the
  separate nests or formicaries which have their origin from the natural increase of a single
  original nest keep up by some means a connection between the members, and so form a colony of
  nests whose inhabitants live together on amicable terms, yet there is no definite information as
  to how long such association lasts, as to what is the nature of the ties that connect the members
  of the different nests, nor as to the means by which the colonies become dissociated. It is known
  that individual nests last a long time. Charles Darwin has mentioned in a letter to Forel that an
  old man of eighty told him he had noticed one very large nest of <i>Formica rufa</i> in the same
  place ever since he was a boy. But what period they usually endure is not known, and all these
  points probably vary greatly according to the species concerned. It has been well ascertained that
  when some ants find their nests, for some unknown reason, to be unsuitable the inhabitants leave
  their abodes, carrying with them their young and immature forms, and being accompanied or followed
  by the various parasites or commensals that are living with them. Wasmann and other entomologists
  have observed that the ants carry bodily some of their favourite beetle-companions, as well as
  members of their own species. Forel observed that after a nest of <i>Formica pratensis</i> had
  been separated into two nests placed at a considerable distance from one another so as to have no
  intercommunication, the members yet recognised one another as parts of the same family after the
  lapse of more than a month; but another observation showed that after some years of separation
  they were no longer so recognised.</p>

  <p>Although it is now well ascertained that ants are able to distinguish the individuals belonging
  to their own nests and colonies from those that, though of their own species, are not so related
  to them, yet it is not known by what means the recognition is effected; there is, however, some
  reason to suppose that it <span class="pagenum" id="page155"><span
  class="smaller">{155}</span></span>is by something of the nature of odour. One observer has
  noticed that if an ant fall into water it is on emerging at first treated as if it were a stranger
  by its own friends; but other naturalists have found this not to be the case in other species.
  Contact with corrosive sublimate deprives ants for a time of this power of recognising friends,
  and under its influence they attack one another in the most ferocious mariner.</p>

  <p>The nests and colonies of the species of Camponotides we have considered are all constructed by
  societies comprising a great number of individuals; there are, however, in the tropics numerous
  species that form their nests on foliage, and some of these contain only a few individuals. The
  leaf-nests (Fig. 64) of certain species of <i>Polyrhachis</i> are said to be formed of a
  paper-like material, and to contain each a female and about 8 or 10 worker ants. Forel<a
  id="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> has examined nests of several Indian species, and
  finds they differ from those of other ants in consisting of a single cavity, lined with silk like
  that of a spider. These nests are further said to be constructed so as to render them either
  inconspicuous or like other objects on the leaves; <i>P. argentea</i> covers its small dwelling
  with little bits of vegetable matter, and a nest of <i>P. rastella</i> was placed between two
  leaves in such a manner as to be entirely hidden. All the species of the genus do not, however,
  share these habits, <i>P. mayri</i> making a card-nest, like <i>Dolichoderus</i> and some other
  ants. The species of the genus <i>Polyrhachis</i> are numerous in the tropics of the Old
  World.</p>

  <p>Forbes noticed that a species of this genus, that makes its paper-like nest on the underside of
  bamboo-leaves produces a noise <span class="pagenum" id="page156"><span
  class="smaller">{156}</span></span>by striking the leaf with its head in a series of spasmodic
  taps. The same observer has recorded a still more interesting fact in the case of another species
  of this genus&mdash;a large brown ant&mdash;found in Sumatra. The individuals were "spread over a
  space, perhaps a couple of yards in diameter, on the stem, leaves, and branches of a great tree
  which had fallen, and not within sight of each other; yet the tapping was set up at the same
  moment, continued exactly the same space of time, and stopped at the same instant; after the lapse
  of a few seconds all recommenced at the same instant. The interval was always of about the same
  duration, though I did not time it; each ant did not, however, beat synchronously with every other
  in the congeries nearest to me; there were independent tappings, so that a sort of tune was
  played, each congeries dotting out its own music, yet the beginnings and endings of the musical
  parties were strictly synchronous."</p>

  <p class="sp3">Mr. Peal has also recorded that an ant&mdash;the name is not mentioned, but it may
  be presumed to be an Assamese species&mdash;makes a concerted noise loud enough to be heard by a
  human being at twenty or thirty feet distance, the sound being produced by each ant scraping the
  horny apex of the abdomen three times in rapid succession on the dry, crisp leaves of which the
  nest is usually composed. These records suggest that these foliage-ants keep up a connection
  between the members of different nests somewhat after the same fashion as do so many of the
  terrestrial Camponotides. Although the species of Camponotides have no special organ for the
  production of sound in the position in which one is found in Myrmicides and Ponerides, yet it is
  probable that they are able to produce a sound by rubbing together other parts of the abdomen.</p>

  <p>The Dolichoderides are similar to Camponotides in appearance, and are distinguished chiefly by
  the structure of the sting and the poison apparatus. To this we may add that Forel also considers
  the gizzard to be different in the two sub-families, there being no visible calyx in the
  Dolichoderides, while this part is largely developed in the Camponotides. This is one of the least
  extensive of the sub-families of ants, not more than 150 species being yet discovered.
  Comparatively little is known of the natural history of its members, only a very small number of
  species of Dolichoderides being found in Europe. The best known of these (and the only British
  Dolichoderid) is <i>Tapinoma erraticum</i>, a little ant of about the size of <i>Lasius niger</i>,
  and somewhat similar in appearance, but very different in its habits. <i>T. erraticum</i> does not
  cultivate or appreciate Aphides, but is chiefly carnivorous in its tastes. Our knowledge of it is
  due to Forel, who has noticed that it is very fond of attending the fights between other ants.
  Here it plays the part of an interested spectator, and watching its opportunity drags off the dead
  body of one of the combatants in order to use it as food. Although destitute of all power of
  stinging, this Insect has a very useful means of defence in the anal glands with which it is
  provided; these secrete a fluid having a strong characteristic odour, and possessing apparently
  very noxious qualities when applied to other ants. The <i>Tapinoma</i> has no power of ejecting
  the fluid to a distance, but is very skilful in placing this odorous matter on the body of an
  opponent by touching the latter with the tip of the abdomen; on this being done its adversary is
  usually discomfited. This <span class="pagenum" id="page158"><span
  class="smaller">{158}</span></span>Insect is subterranean in its habits, and is said to change its
  abode very frequently. <i>T. erraticum</i> occurs somewhat rarely in Britain. Forel has also noted
  the habits of <i>Liometopum microcephalum</i>, another small European species of Dolichoderides.
  It is a tree-ant, and by preference adopts, and adapts for its use, the burrows made by
  wood-boring beetles. It forms extremely populous colonies which may extend over several large
  trees, the inhabitants keeping up intercommunication by means of numerous workers. No less than
  twelve mighty oaks were found to be thus united into a colony of this ant in one of the Bulgarian
  forests. The species is very warlike, and compensates for the extreme minuteness of its
  individuals by the skilful and rapid rushes made by combined numbers on their ant-foes of larger
  size.</p>

  <p>Fritz M&uuml;ller has given a brief account, under the name of the Imbauba ant, of a Brazilian
  arboreal ant, that forms small nests in the interior of plants. The species referred to is no
  doubt an <i>Azteca</i>, and either <i>A. instabilis</i>, or <i>A. mulleri</i>. The nests are
  founded by fertilised females which may frequently be found in the cells on young <i>Cecropia</i>
  plants. Each internode, he says, has on the outside, near its upper part, a small pit where the
  wall is much thinner, and in this the female makes a hole by which she enters. Soon afterwards the
  hole is completely closed by a luxuriant excrescence from its margins, and it remains thus closed
  until about a dozen workers have developed from the eggs of the female, when the hole is opened
  anew from within by the workers. It is said that many of the larvae of these ants are devoured by

  <p>Certain genera of small European ants of the group Myrmicini display some most anomalous
  phenomena. This is especially the case in <i>Formicoxenus</i>, <i>Anergates</i> and
  <i>Tomognathus</i>. The facts known have, however, been most of them only recently discovered, and
  some obscurity still exists as to many of even the more important points in these extraordinary

  <p>It has long been known that the little <i>Formicoxenus nitidulus</i> lives as a guest in the
  nests of <i>Formica rufa</i>, the wood-ant; and another similar ant, <i>Stenamma westwoodi</i>,
  which shares the same life, was declared by Nylander and Smith to be its male; it was however
  shown some years ago by Andr&eacute; that this is a mistake, and that <i>S. westwoodi</i> is really the
  male of another ant that had till then been called <i>Asemorhoptrum lippulum</i>. This correction
  left the workers and females of <i>Formicoxenus nitidulus</i> destitute of a male, but Adlerz has
  recently discovered that the male of this species is wingless and similar to the worker, the
  female being a winged Insect as usual. It is very curious that the characters by which the male is
  distinguished from the worker should vary in this species; but according to Adlerz this is the
  case, individuals intermediate in several points between the males and workers having been
  discovered. This phenomenon of quite wingless males in species where the female is winged is most
  exceptional, and is extremely rare in Insects; but it occurs, as we shall see, in one or two other
  Myrmicides. Charles Darwin made the very reasonable suggestion that winged males may be developed
  occasionally as an exceptional phenomenon, and it is very probable that this may be the case,
  though it has not yet been demonstrated. <i>Formicoxenus nitidulus</i> occurs in England in the
  nests of <i>Formica rufa</i> and of <i>F. congerens</i>, but we are not aware that the male has
  ever been found in this country. The genus <i>Anergates</i> is allied to <i>Formicoxenus</i>, and
  occurs in Central Europe, but has not been found in Britain; the female, as in
  <i>Formicoxenus</i>, is winged and the male wingless, but there is no worker-caste; the male is a
  rather helpless creature, and incapable of leaving the nest. The species lives in company with
  <i>Tetramorium caespitum</i> a little ant very like <i>Myrmica</i>, and not uncommon in South-East
  England. The female <i>Anergates</i> is at <span class="pagenum" id="page161"><span
  class="smaller">{161}</span></span>first an active little creature with wings, but after these are
  lost the body of the Insect becomes extremely distended as shown in Fig. 69, C; the creature is in
  this state entirely helpless, and as there are no workers, the <i>Anergates</i> is completely
  dependent, for the existence of itself and its larvae, on the friendly offices of the
  <i>Tetramorium</i> that lives with it. The mode of the association of these two Insects is at
  present both unparalleled and inexplicable, for only workers of the <i>Tetramorium</i> are found
  in company with the &#x2642; and &#x2640; <i>Anergates</i>; the community, in fact, consisting of
  males and females of one species and workers of another. The nests of <i>Anergates</i> are so rare
  that only a few naturalists have been able to observe them (Schenk, von Hagens, and Forel may be
  specially mentioned), but in the spots where they occur, nests of the <i>Tetramorium</i>,
  containing all the forms of that species, are numerous, and it therefore seems probable that a
  young fertile female of the <i>Anergates</i> may leave a nest in which it was born, enter a nest
  of the <i>Tetramorium</i>, and, destroying the queen thereof, substitute herself in the place of
  the victim; but if this be really the case, the larvae and pupae of the <i>Tetramorium</i> must
  also be destroyed, for no young of the <i>Tetramorium</i> are ever found in these strange
  associations. It is very difficult to believe that the <i>Tetramorium</i> workers should be
  willing to accept as their queen a creature that commenced her acquaintance with them by
  destroying their own queen or queens and a number of their young sisters; especially as the
  <i>Tetramorium</i> is a more powerful ant than the <i>Anergates</i>, and could readily dispose of
  the murderous intruder if it were disposed to do so. It is known, however, that colonies of
  <i>Tetramorium</i> completely destitute of queens sometimes occur, and Wasmann has suggested that
  the female <i>Anergates</i> may seek out one of these, and installing herself therein as a
  substitute, may be accepted by the orphaned colony. This plausible hypothesis has still to be
  verified.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cardiocondyla</i> also exhibits the phenomenon of apterous, worker-like males,
  while in one species, <i>C. emeryi</i>, a winged male is also known to exist.</p>

  <p><i>Tomognathus sublaevis</i> is a little Myrmicid ant, found rarely in Denmark and Sweden,
  where its habits have recently been studied by Adlerz. A band of the <i>Tomognathus</i> attack the
  nest of another little Myrmicid, <i>Leptothorax acervorum</i>, and succeed by their own
  pertinacity and the fears of the <i>Leptothorax</i> in <span class="pagenum" id="page162"><span
  class="smaller">{162}</span></span>obtaining possession of it; the legitimate owners disappear,
  leaving the <i>Tomognathus</i> in possession of their larvae and pupae; these complete their
  development only to find themselves the slaves of <i>Tomognathus</i>. The subsequent relations of
  the two ants are friendly, the slaves even preventing their masters from wandering from the nest
  when they wish to do so. If an established mixed community of this nature is in want of additional
  servitors, the <i>Tomognathus</i> secure a supply by raids after the fashion of the Amazon-ant,
  bringing back to their abode larvae and pupae of <i>Leptothorax</i> to be developed as slaves. It
  was formerly supposed that the <i>Tomognathus</i> continued its species by perpetual
  parthenogenesis of the workers, for neither males nor females could be found. Adlerz<a id="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> has, however, now discovered the sexual individuals. The male is
  an ordinary winged ant, and is so like that sex of the <i>Leptothorax</i>, that Adlerz had failed
  to distinguish the two before he reared them. The females are apterous, and in fact like the
  workers. It would perhaps be more correct to say that the workers of this species vary greatly but
  never become winged; some of them have ocelli and a structure of the thorax more or less similar
  to that of winged females, though none have been found with wings. Certain of these females
  possess a receptaculum seminis, and Adlerz treats this as the true distinction between female and
  worker. In accordance with this view the female of <i>Tomognathus</i> may be described as a
  worker-like individual possessing a receptaculum seminis, and having more or less of the external
  structures of winged females, though never being actually winged. It is probable that other
  workers reproduce parthenogenetically. The males of this species will not unite with females from
  the same nest, thus differing from many other ants, in which union between individuals of the same
  nest is the rule. Finally, to complete this curious history, we should remark that the larvae of
  the <i>Tomognathus</i> are so similar to those of the <i>Leptothorax</i> that Adlerz is quite
  unable to distinguish the two.</p>

  <p><i>Strongylognathus testaceus</i> and <i>S. huberi</i> live in association with <i>Tetramorium
  caespitum</i>, and are cared for by these latter ants; it is notable that as in the case of the
  slave-making <i>Polyergus rufescens</i> the mandibles of the <i>Strongylognathus</i> are
  cylindrical and pointed, and therefore unsuitable for industrial occupations. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page163"><span class="smaller">{163}</span></span><i>S. testaceus</i> is a
  weak little ant, and lives in small numbers in the nests with <i>T. caespitum</i>, which it is
  said to greatly resemble in appearance. The proportions of the forms of the two species usually
  associated is peculiar, there being a great many workers of <i>T. caespitum</i> both in the
  perfect and pupal states, and also all the sexes of the <i>Strongylognathus</i>, of which,
  however, only a few are workers. This would seem to suggest that <i>S. testaceus</i> attacks and
  pillages the nests of <i>T. caespitum</i> in order to carry off worker pupae, just as <i>Polyergus
  rufescens</i> does. But the facts that <i>S. testaceus</i> is a weaker Insect than the
  <i>Tetramorium</i>, and that only a few of its worker-caste are present in a community where there
  are many workers of the <i>Tetramorium</i>, seem to negative the view that the latter were
  captured by the former; and the mode in which the associated communities of these two species are
  started and kept up is still therefore in need of explanation.</p>

  <p><i>Strongylognathus huberi</i> is a much stronger Insect than its congener, <i>S.
  testaceus</i>, and Forel has witnessed its attack on <i>Tetramorium caespitum</i>. Here the raid
  is made in a similar manner to that of <i>Polyergus rufescens</i> on <i>Formica</i>; the
  <i>Tetramorium</i> is attacked, and its pupae carried off to the abode of the
  <i>Strongylognathus</i> to serve in due time as its slaves. The mandibles of <i>S. huberi</i>,
  being similar in form to those of <i>Polyergus rufescens</i> are used in a similar manner.</p>

  <p>Although <i>T. caespitum</i> is common enough in South-East England, it is to be regretted that
  none of the guests or associates we have mentioned in connection with it occur in this country. It
  is a most variable species, and is distributed over a large part of the globe.</p>

  <p>Our British species of Myrmicides, about ten in number, all belong to the group Myrmicini; none
  of them are generally common except <i>Myrmica rubra</i>, which is a most abundant Insect, and
  forms numerous races that have been considered by some entomologists to be distinct species; the
  two most abundant of these races are <i>M. ruginodis</i> and <i>M. scabrinodis</i>, which
  sometimes, at the time of the appearance of the winged individuals, form vast swarms.</p>

  <p>The tiny <i>Monomorium pharaonis</i> is a species that has been introduced into Britain, but
  now occurs in houses in certain towns; it sometimes accumulates on provisions in such numbers as
  to be a serious nuisance. Seventeen thousand <span class="pagenum" id="page164"><span
  class="smaller">{164}</span></span>individuals weigh 1 gramme, and it is probable that a nest may
  include millions of specimens.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Aphaenogaster</i><a id="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> and its
  immediate allies include the harvesting ants of Europe and North America: they form subterranean
  nests consisting of isolated chambers connected by galleries; some of the chambers are used as
  store-houses or granaries, considerable quantities of corn, grass, and other seeds being placed in
  them. <i>A. structor</i> and <i>A. barbarus</i> have been observed to do this in Southern Europe,
  by Lesp&egrave;s, Moggridge, and others.</p>

  <p>In the deserts about Algeria and Tunis a harvesting ant, <i>Aphaenogaster (Messor)
  arenarius</i>, is an important creature: its subterranean dwellings are very extensive, and are
  placed at a depth of several feet from the surface. Entrance to these dwellings is obtained by
  small holes, which are the orifices of galleries many feet in length: the holes are surrounded by
  pellets of sand projecting somewhat above the general surface, and consequently making the places
  conspicuous. The subterranean works occupy an area of fifty or a hundred square yards excavated at
  a depth of three to six feet. In these immense nests there exists a form of worker, of very small
  size, that never comes to the surface.<a id="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</i> and other species have been observed to do harvesting in North
  America. After the workers of <i>P. barbatus</i> have taken the seeds into the nest they separate
  the husks and carry them out, depositing them on a heap or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page165"><span class="smaller">{165}</span></span>kitchen-midden, formed near by. M&lsquo;Cook
  has witnessed and described the process of stripping the seeds.</p>

  <p>Certain genera&mdash;e.g. <i>Aphaenogaster</i>, <i>Pheidole</i>&mdash;exhibit great disparity
  in the forms of the workers, some of which are of size much superior to the others, and possess
  disproportionately large heads; these large individuals are found in the same nest as the smaller
  forms. All the intermediate forms may frequently be found, and at the same time, in the genus
  <i>Aphaenogaster</i>; but in <i>Pheidole</i> intermediates are of the utmost rarity.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cremastogaster</i> is remarkable on account of the shape of the hind body and its
  articulation, which give the abdomen the appearance of being put on upside down. This mode of
  articulation may allow the Insect to threaten its enemies when they are in front of it; but it is
  doubtful whether the <i>Cremastogaster</i> possesses an effective sting.</p>

  <p>ii. The group Attini is distinguished by the presence of a carina near the eye, by the antennae
  being inserted at a moderate distance from one another, by the clypeus being prolonged backwards
  between them; and by the absence of a sting. The group is not represented in Europe, but in
  Tropical America the ants belonging to it are amongst the most important of natural objects. The
  species of the genus <i>Atta</i> (usually styled <i>Oecodoma</i>) are the formidable leaf-cutting
  ants of America. They occur in enormous colonies in certain places, and will in a short time
  completely strip a tree of its leaves. As they appear to prefer trees of a useful kind, especially
  those planted by man, their ravages are often of the most serious nature. The natives, feeling it
  hopeless to contend with these Insect hordes, only too frequently abandon all attempts to
  cultivate the trees and vegetables the Insects are fond of. Both Bates and Belt have <span
  class="pagenum" id="page166"><span class="smaller">{166}</span></span>given accounts of some
  points in the economy of these ants. They are amongst the largest of the Formicidae, the females
  in some cases measuring about two and a half inches across their expanded wings; the males are
  much smaller, but are less dissimilar to their partners than is usual among ants. The workers, on
  the other hand, are so extremely different, that no one would suppose them to be at all related to
  the males and females (see vol. v. Fig. 339).</p>

  <p>The mode of operation of these ants is to form paths from their formicary extending for a
  considerable distance in various directions, so that they have a ready access to any spot in a
  district of considerable extent; when a tree or bush is found bearing leaves suitable for their
  purposes, the worker ants ascend it in large numbers and cut up the leaves by biting out of them
  pieces similar in size and shape to a small coin; these pieces are then carried back in the jaws
  of the ants to their nests; the ant-paths are therefore constantly traversed by bands of little
  creatures carrying burdens homewards, or hurrying outwards in search of suitable trees.</p>

  <p>The formicaries are of considerable size, and are described as consisting of low mounds of bare
  earth of considerable extent. Bates speaks of as great a circumference as forty yards; these
  accumulations of earth have frequently an appearance different from the adjoining soil, owing to
  their being formed of subsoil brought up from below; they are kept bare by the ants constantly
  bringing to and depositing on the surface fresh material resulting from their subterranean
  excavations. The true abodes, beneath the earth, are of greater extent than the mounds themselves,
  and extend to a considerable depth; they consist of chambers connected by galleries.</p>

  <p>The leaf-cutting ants extend their range to North America, and M&lsquo;Cook has recently called
  attention to a case there in which <i>A. fervens</i> made an underground route at an average depth
  of 18 inches, and at an occasional depth of 6 feet, extending 448 feet entirely beneath the earth,
  after which it was continued for 185 feet to reach a tree which the ants were engaged in
  defoliating. This route, extending altogether to a length of more than 600 feet, presented only a
  very slight deviation from a straight line drawn between the point of departure and the object to
  be attained. By what sense this ant was enabled <span class="pagenum" id="page167"><span
  class="smaller">{167}</span></span>to make a subterranean tunnel in a straight line to a desired
  object situated at so great a distance, we know not.</p>

  <p>The use the leaf-cutting ants make of the enormous amount of material they gather was for long
  a subject of debate, and has only recently been ascertained by the observations of M&ouml;ller. After
  being carried to the nest the pieces of leaves are cut into small fragments by another set of
  workers and formed into balls, which are packed in various parts of the nest, and amongst which
  the mycelium of a fungus&mdash;<i>Rozites gongylophora</i>&mdash;ramifies. This fungus the ants
  cultivate in the most skilful manner: they manage to keep it clear from mouldiness and bacterial
  agents, and to make it produce a modified form of growth in the shape of little white masses, each
  one formed by an agglomeration of swellings of the mycelium. These form the chief food of the
  colony. M&ouml;ller ascertained by experiment that the results were due to a true cultivation on the
  part of the ants: when they were taken away from the nests, the mycelium produced two kinds of
  conidia instead of the ant-food.</p>

  <p>Many details of the economy of these leaf-cutting ants are still very imperfectly known. The
  large-headed forms, called soldiers, have been the subject of contradictory statements; Bates
  having concluded from his own observations that they are harmless, while Mr. J. H. Hart assures us
  that they are very fierce and vindictive, and inflict very serious wounds by biting (the Attini do
  not sting). We anticipate that the observations of both these naturalists will prove to be
  substantially correct, and that the differences in habits will be found to be owing to
  distinctions in the conditions of the community. In connection with this point we may remark that
  the function of the excessively large heads of certain kinds of soldier-ants is still obscure. In
  the East Indian <i>Pheidologeton diversus</i> the big soldiers are quite one hundred times as
  large as the smaller workers. As these latter bite viciously it would naturally be supposed that
  their gigantic <i>confr&egrave;res</i> with enormous heads would be warriors of a most formidable nature;
  but, as a matter of fact, the giants are unable to bite even when they try to do so. Aitken has
  somewhere suggested that these enormous individuals play the part of state elephants; and we have
  been informed by Colonel Bingham that the small ants may frequently be seen riding in numbers on
  their unwieldy fellows. We anticipate <span class="pagenum" id="page168"><span
  class="smaller">{168}</span></span>however, that some other function will be found to exist for
  these forms with enormous heads. An examination of their organs of sense and of voice is very
  desirable.</p>

  <p>Details of the modes in which the great communities of the leaf-cutting Attidae are maintained,
  are still wanting. The females do not, we have been informed by Mr. Hart, possess any considerable
  powers of aftergrowth, so that there is no reason to suppose them to be unusually prolific. At
  certain seasons great swarms of winged individuals are produced, and after leaving the nests pair
  in the manner of our European <i>Myrmica</i>. Possibly the females may, after losing their wings,
  again enter the large communities. Von Ihering states that the workers of <i>Atta lundi</i> are
  fertile.</p>

  <p>iii. The group Pseudomyrmini includes the genera <i>Pseudomyrma</i> and <i>Sima</i>, which are
  by some entomologists treated as but a single genus. The antennae are inserted near together on
  the front of the head; there is no carina on the head external to their insertion, and the clypeus
  does not extend forwards between them. The Insects are usually of elongate form, possess a sting,
  and have a naked pupa. The group occurs in both hemispheres, but is exclusively exotic, and but
  little is known of the habits of its members. Forel has recently observed that numerous species
  live inside dried stems of grass or in hollow twigs, and are beautifully adapted for this mode of
  life by their elongate form, some of them being as slender as needles. Some interesting
  observations have been made in Nicaragua by Belt on <i>Pseudomyrma bicolor</i> and its relations
  with an acacia-tree, in the thorns of which it lives. The acacia in question is called the
  bull's-horn thorn, because the branches and trunk are armed with strong curved spines, set in
  pairs, and much resembling the horns of the quadruped whose name they bear. The ant takes
  possession of a thorn by boring a small hole near the distal extremity, and forms its nest inside.
  The leaves of this plant are provided with glands that secrete a honey-like fluid, which it
  appears forms the chief, if not the sole, subsistence of the ant. Belt considers that the presence
  of the ant is beneficial to the acacia; he supposes that the ants assume the rights of
  proprietors, and will not allow caterpillars or leaf-cutting ants to meddle with their property;
  the leaves are, he thinks, so preserved to the benefit of the tree.</p>

  <p>Rothney has given some particulars of the habits of <i>Sima rufo-nigra</i>, an ant of this
  group that appears to be not uncommon near Calcutta, where it lives on the trunks of trees in
  company with a spider and a wasp that greatly resemble it in form and in colour. The three
  creatures seem to associate together on amicable terms; indeed the wasp and the ant occasionally
  indulge in wrestling matches without doing one another any serious harm. In connection with this

  of agility.</p>

  <p>iv. The Cryptocerini are distinguished from other ants by their antennae being inserted at the
  sides of the head, where they are placed between ridges or in a groove into which they can be
  withdrawn; when in some cases they are entirely concealed. These ants assume a great variety of
  shapes and forms, some of which look almost as if they were the results of an extravagant
  imagination. The skeleton is usually much harder than it is in other <span class="pagenum"
  id="page170"><span class="smaller">{170}</span></span>ants; the abdomen consists almost entirely
  of one very large segment, there being, however, three others visible at its extremity; these
  segments can be only slightly protruded, and the ants have no power of stinging. They are probably
  most of them arboreal in their habits. Nearly all of the known forms are exotic. According to the
  observations of Bates the species of the genus <i>Cryptocerus</i> in the Amazons Valley may
  frequently be observed in dry open places on low trees and bushes, or running on branches of newly
  felled trees; they also visit flowers abundantly. The species generally are wood-borers, usually
  perforating the dead branches of trees. <i>C. atratus</i> has been observed to construct its nests
  in the dead, suspended branches of woody climbers; a number of neatly drilled holes are all that
  can be seen externally; but, inside, the wood is freely perforated with intercommunicating
  galleries. Each community appears to consist of a single female and two kinds of workers; the
  latter in some species are quite unlike each other, differing in the form of the head, and in the
  armature of the thorax and nodes of the peduncle. The species of <i>Cryptocerus</i> appear to be
  omnivorous, and are frequently attracted by the excrement of birds. The pupae are not enclosed in
  a cocoon. In the South of Europe two very minute ants, of the genera <i>Strumigenys</i> and
  <i>Epitritus</i>, belonging to this family, are met with under very large stones partly embedded
  in the earth. They are of the greatest rarity.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This sub-family includes numerous genera and about 400 species. The Ponerides have an elongate
  hind-body; the second segment behind the node is capable of great movement in and out of the
  preceding segment, and for this purpose is furnished with a basal portion slightly more slender
  than the apical part; this <span class="pagenum" id="page171"><span
  class="smaller">{171}</span></span>basal part is usually concealed within the more anterior
  segment, the hind margin of which embraces it very closely. On the middle of the dorsal aspect of
  this articulation there is usually placed a stridulating organ, consisting of an elongate band or
  patch of very fine lines; this gives out a sound when the second segment is moved in and out of
  the first at a time when the posterior edge of the latter is slightly depressed.</p>

  <p>We follow Forel in including the Australian bull-dog ants&mdash;<i>Myrmecia</i>&mdash;in
  Ponerides, as well as the Odontomachi. The former have, however, a definite pedicel, consisting of
  two nodes (Fig. 76). In the Odontomachi the mandibles are approximate at their bases, being
  inserted on the middle of the front of the head (Fig. 77).</p>

  <p>This sub-family includes a considerable number of species, and is found in all parts of the
  world. Extremely little is known as to the habits, but the true Ponerides do not, so far as is
  known, occur in large communities, and it seems probable that they are destitute of the powers of
  combined action that are so remarkable in the Camponotides, and in some of the Myrmicides and
  Dorylides. Most of the species that have been described are known by only one sex, so that very
  little knowledge exists as to the sexual distinctions; but from the little that is known it would
  appear that the three sexual forms are not so differentiated as they are in most of the
  Camponotides and Myrmicides.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The species of the genus <i>Leptogenys</i> are believed by Emery and Forel to possess an
  apterous female. Mr. Perkins has observed that the Hawaiian <i>L. falcigera</i> has workers with
  different kinds of sting, but no true female. Males of this species are, however, abundant.
  Wroughton has recently discovered that one member of this genus is of Termitophagous habits, but
  this is not the case with <i>L. falcigera</i>. <i>Dinoponera grandis</i> (Fig. 75) is the largest
  of the Ponerides, its <span class="pagenum" id="page172"><span
  class="smaller">{172}</span></span>workers attaining an inch and a quarter in length. This Insect,
  according to Bates, marches in single file in the thickets at Par&aacute;; its colonies consist of a
  small number of individuals, and are established at the roots of slender trees. The effects of its
  powerful sting are not so serious as is the case with some of the smaller ants.</p>

  <p>In Britain we have only two representatives of the sub-family, viz. <i>Ponera contracta</i>, a
  small ant of dirty-yellow colour, found rarely in the Southern counties, living in moss or under
  stones. Its colonies consist of only a few individuals; Forel giving fifty as the highest number
  he has observed. The second species, <i>P. punctatissima</i>, presents the almost unique
  peculiarity of possessing two forms of the male sex, one of them resembling the worker in most of
  its peculiarities, and in being destitute of wings, while the other is winged, as is usual in male
  ants. In the island of St. Vincent another species of <i>Ponera</i> has been discovered having an
  apterous and worker-like male, and was named by Forel <i>P. ergatandria</i>.<a id="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> The discovery of this form has led him to express some doubt as
  to whether <i>Ponera punctatissima</i> has two forms of males; but it seems probable that it
  really is so, the ergatoid males being produced under somewhat different circumstances from the
  normal males. We shall subsequently see that <i>Cardiocondyla</i> and a few other Myrmicides
  exhibit an analogous peculiarity.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Myrmecia</i> is confined to the Australian continent and Tasmania, and includes a
  considerable number of species of large and moderate-sized ants, the classification of which has
  been a subject of difference of opinion. This has arisen from the fact that the nodes of the
  abdominal pedicel are more similar to those existing in the Myrmicides than to those of the
  typical Ponerides. There are, however, some American members of the latter sub-family
  (<i>Paraponera clavata</i>, <i>e.g.</i>) that differ but little in this point from
  <i>Myrmecia</i>, and, moreover, the pupae of <i>Myrmecia</i> are enclosed in a cocoon, while in
  the Myrmicides they are usually naked. On the other hand the nests are, it appears, very large and
  populous, more like what exists in the Myrmicides; there is no true stridulating organ on the
  first abdominal segment. The genus is therefore one of those interesting anomalies that form so
  large a proportion of the Australian <span class="pagenum" id="page173"><span
  class="smaller">{173}</span></span>fauna, and will probably be ultimately treated as a distinct
  sub-family. There are about thirty species.</p>

  <p>The ants of this genus are well known to the residents in Australia, where they are called
  "bull-dog ants." They form large mounds of earth for their nests. The workers, and females (Fig.
  76) are much alike except during the period when the latter are still carrying their wings. The
  males, however, differ considerably, being of more slender form, and possessing only insignificant
  mandibles, and straight antennae with a quite short basal joint.</p>

  <p>Forel considers <i>Myrmecia</i> to be the most formidable of all the ants; the hills are said
  to be sometimes five feet high, and the colonies are immense in numbers, while the Insect is an
  inch or more in length, and armed with a very powerful sting, the use of which on the human body
  is said to give rise in some cases to serious symptoms. On the other hand, we have seen statements
  to the effect that the sting of <i>Myrmecia</i> has only very evanescent sequelae; it is also said
  that the ant-hills have only a slight elevation, so that probably both these points differ
  according to the species. It appears from a communication of Miss Shepherd's that the formidable
  <i>Myrmecia forficata</i> has its larvae destroyed by a parasitic Hymenopteron (<i>Eucharis
  myrmeciae</i>) of brilliant colour and considerable size, so that we have the curious fact of the
  hordes of this most formidably armed ant, which possesses also large eyes, falling a victim to a
  brilliant and very conspicuous Insect. Particulars of this case of parasitic attack are still
  wanting. There are other cases known of the larvae of ants being destroyed by parasitic Diptera
  and Hymenoptera, but in none of them have any sufficient observations been made as to the mode in
  which the attack is made. Lowne says that <i>M. gulosa</i> itself attacks large beetles of the
  genus <i>Anoplognathus</i> and buries them; and he also adds the very curious statement that <i>M.
  nigrocincta</i>, when running, is able to take leaps of a foot in length.</p>

  <p>The Odontomachi were formerly considered a distinct sub-family, distinguished by the peculiar
  mandibles (Fig. 77). <span class="pagenum" id="page174"><span
  class="smaller">{174}</span></span>Many of the Ponerides have elongate mandibles, but they are
  inserted at the sides of the front of the head, not in the middle of the front. These organs in
  some species of Odontomachi serve as levers, by aid of which the Insect can execute considerable
  leaps. In only a few species are the males known; Mayr and Forel state that they are destitute of
  the peculiar mandibles characteristic of the worker.</p>

  <p>The unique European representative of the Odontomachi, <i>Anochetus ghiliani</i>, occurs in
  Andalusia. Near Tangier Mr. George Lewis found it to be not uncommon; but the sexes are not known,
  and it even appears doubtful whether there exists any well-marked division between workers and
  female. Lewis observed, among the ordinary forms, individuals with longer bodies, usually one in a
  nest, and he supposed these to be females; Saunders, on examining these examples, found them to
  possess distinct ocelli, and therefore agreed with Lewis as to their being the female sex. Dr.
  Emery subsequently examined these same specimens, and took what is scarcely a different view, viz.
  that they are not females but an intermediate form; and he also expressed the opinion that "the
  true female may not exist." The male of <i>Anochetus</i> is not known. The female of <i>A.

  <p>We have reserved to the end of the ants the consideration of the two groups Dorylides and
  Amblyoponides, recent investigations having rendered it somewhat doubtful whether they can be
  maintained as distinct from Ponerides. The chief character of the Dorylides is that the males are
  much less ant-like in form than they are in the other groups, and that the distinction between the
  females and workers are enormous. The little that is known as to the males and females of this
  group suggests the view that these sexes may offer sufficient reason for keeping the Dorylides as
  a group distinct from the other ants; but it must be admitted that it is very difficult to find
  satisfactory characters to distinguish the workers of the Dorylides in some cases from the
  Ponerides, in others (<i>Eciton</i>) from the Myrmicides.<a id="NtA_72"

  <p>The Dorylides are of great interest, for they exhibit the remarkable phenomenon of a nomadic
  social life, accompanied by imperfect sight in the wanderers. The sub-family includes two
  apparently distinct groups: (1) the Ecitonini, peculiar to the New World, and having a close
  relationship with the Myrmicides; and (2) the Dorylini existing chiefly in the eastern hemisphere,
  and related closely by its workers to the Ponerides and Amblyoponides. (i.) The Ecitonini consist
  of the species of the genus <i>Eciton</i>, the wandering ants of America, and of <i>Labidus</i>,
  which there is now good reason for believing to consist of the males of <i>Eciton</i>. The female
  is still uncertain. The <i>Eciton</i> are nomad ants having no fixed abode, but wandering from
  place to place in search of prey, and forming temporary resting-places. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page176"><span class="smaller">{176}</span></span>species are rather numerous, and the habits
  of several have been described by Bates, who, however, was not acquainted with some of the most
  peculiar features in their biology, these having been since revealed by Belt and W. M&uuml;ller.</p>

  <p>These ants are predaceous in their habits, and some of the species travel in vast hordes; they
  occasionally enter houses and clear them of much of the vermin with which they may be infested.
  They have no facetted eyes, some of the forms being quite blind, while others have a pair of
  peculiar lenses in the position normally occupied by the compound eyes. Usually there are two
  castes of the workers, and in some species these are very different from one another, the
  mandibles being in the larger form very elongate, cylindrical and unfit for industrial purposes,
  while the individuals of the smaller caste have the outer jaws shorter, with their edges apposed
  and coadapted: in other species individuals with mandibles differentiated from the normal form do
  not exist. The nomad habits of these ants were described by Bates, but the detection of their
  temporary resting-places was reserved for Belt, who found that, after their plundering raids, they
  retired to a place of concealment, and there clustered together in a compact mass like a swarm of
  bees. Belt says: "They make their temporary habitations in hollow trees and sometimes underneath
  large fallen trunks that offer suitable hollows. A nest that I came across in the latter situation
  was open at one side. The ants were clustered together in a dense mass, like a great swarm of
  bees, hanging from the roof, but reaching to the ground below. Their innumerable long legs looked
  like brown threads binding together the mass, which must have been at least a cubic yard in bulk,
  and contained hundreds of thousands of individuals, although many columns were outside, some
  bringing in the pupae of ants, others the legs and dissected bodies of various Insects. I was
  surprised to see in this living nest tubular passages leading down to the centre of the mass, kept
  open, just as if it had been formed of inorganic materials. Down these holes the ants who were
  bringing in booty passed with their prey. I thrust a long stick down to the centre of the cluster
  and brought out clinging to it many ants holding larvae and pupae."</p>

  <p>Turning now to the <i>Labidus</i> question: many American species of this genus have long been
  known, though all of them <span class="pagenum" id="page177"><span
  class="smaller">{177}</span></span>by the male sex only. The discoveries (to be subsequently
  alluded to) made in the Old World as to the relations between the driver ants and <i>Dorylus</i>
  raised a suspicion that <i>Labidus</i> might be the male of <i>Eciton</i>, the distinctions in the
  two cases being very analogous: this conjecture has been almost proved to be correct by the recent
  observations of Hetschko and W. M&uuml;ller. The latter, who observed the temporary nests of <i>Eciton
  hamatum</i>, confirms Belt's statements as to the ants hanging together in clumps, like swarms of
  bees; he also states that the change from one temporary abode to another takes place at night,
  though, as is well known, the hunting forays of this ant are carried on in the daytime. The
  periods of migration appear to be determined by the time at which all the larvae have assumed the
  pupal state, this at any rate being the time chosen in the case observed by M&uuml;ller. This
  naturalist bagged a part of one of the nests by the aid of ether, and found the larger portion to
  consist of pupae; there were also some larvae and eggs; a specimen of <i>Labidus</i> (<i>L.
  burchelli</i>) was also found on friendly terms with the <i>Eciton</i>-workers; and myrmecophilous
  Coleoptera were discovered. The pupae are enclosed in cocoons. Persistent search failed to reveal
  any female, but the examination was made under great difficulties. M&uuml;ller also states that the
  earliest pupated larvae yield soldiers, the latest the smallest forms of workers. From
  observations made by Forel on a pupa, it seems probable that a wingless form of male may be found
  to exist. If therefore, as appears practically certain, <i>Labidus</i> is the winged male of
  <i>Eciton</i>, it is probable also that males of more or less worker-like form exist, as is now
  known to be the case in some other Formicidae.</p>

  <p>We may here notice a peculiar apterous female ant recently described by Andr&eacute; under the name of
  <i>Pseudodicthadia incerta</i>. He thought this might prove to be the female of
  <i>Eciton-Labidus</i>; but his description and figure are imperfect, and do not greatly support
  his idea of a connection between <i>Eciton</i> and <i>Pseudodicthadia</i>.</p>

  <p>ii. The group Dorylini includes the genus <i>Dorylus</i>, which was founded many years ago for
  Insects very like <i>Labidus</i>. As in the case of the American Insect named, males only were
  known; two or three allied genera, consisting exclusively of individuals of the sex mentioned,
  were subsequently described. In the <span class="pagenum" id="page178"><span
  class="smaller">{178}</span></span>regions inhabited by these males numerous species of blind ants
  are known, but only in the worker form, and were, or still are, referred to genera called
  <i>Typhlopone</i> and <i>Anomma</i>. Nothing that could be considered to be a female pertaining to
  any of these Insects was discovered until Gerstaecker described under the generic name
  <i>Dicthadia</i> an extraordinary apterous female ant found in Java, and it was suspected that it
  might be the long-expected female of the male <i>Dorylus</i> and of the worker <i>Typhlopone</i>
  or <i>Anomma</i>. This remained for many years without confirmation, but in 1880 Trimen announced
  the discovery in South Africa of an enormous apterous female ant, allied to <i>Dicthadia</i>; it
  had been disinterred from a nest of small red ants believed (wrongly) to be <i>Anomma</i>. As
  <i>Dorylus</i> had been previously found in connection with allied worker ants it has since then
  been clear that notwithstanding the enormous differences existing between these three forms they
  may all pertain to one (or to closely allied) species. From this summary the student should
  understand that he will find in myrmecological literature many references to two or three genera
  that really belong to one species.</p>

  <p>The workers of the Dorylini at present known are without exception quite blind, and are
  believed to be all of predaceous habits; it is thought by some that they have no fixed abodes,
  but, like the Ecitonini, frequently change their residence, and it has been suggested that in
  doing so they make use of the nests of other ants as temporary abodes; all these points are,
  however, still unsettled, and as there are several genera it is not unlikely that considerable
  variety will be found to prevail. The driver ants of Africa, belonging to the genus <i>Anomma</i>,
  are in some <span class="pagenum" id="page179"><span class="smaller">{179}</span></span>respects
  similar to <i>Eciton</i> in habits, as they enter human habitations and cause nearly everything
  else to quit; it is probable that they are also exclusively carnivorous. Savage detected the nests
  of <i>A. arcens</i>, but the account he has given of them is too vague to permit one to decide
  whether the assemblages he saw were of a nomad kind. The workers of this species vary greatly in
  size, and Emery has recently stated that he believes all the supposed species of the genus to be
  merely varieties of <i>A. burmeisteri</i>. The female of the driver ants is still quite unknown. A
  <i>Dorylus</i> has been ascertained to be the male of <i>Typhlopone</i>. The male <i>Dorylus</i>
  (Figs. 79, A, and 80) is of great interest, for the propodeum is in a more primitive form than it
  is in any other petiolate Hymenopteron known to us, while at the same time the pronotum and
  mesonotum are very highly developed. The genus <i>Typhlatta</i> Sm. has been recently identified
  by Wroughton and Forel as the worker-condition of which <i>Aenictus</i> is the winged male. The
  genus <i>Alaopone</i> will probably be found to have some species of <i>Dorylus</i> as its
  male.</p>

  <p>The females of the Dorylides are amongst the rarest of Insects, and are also amongst the
  greatest of natural curiosities. Although worker ants and female ants are merely forms of one
  sex&mdash;the female&mdash;yet in this sub-family of ants they have become so totally different
  from one another in size, form, structure, and habits that it is difficult to persuade oneself
  they can possibly issue from similar eggs. In the Insect world there are but few cases in which
  males differ from females so greatly as the workers of Dorylides do from the females, the
  phenomena finding their only parallel in the soldiers and females of Termites; the mode in which
  this difference is introduced into the life of the individuals of one sex is unknown. The largest
  of all the Dorylides are the African Insects of the genus <i>Rhogmus</i>. Only the male is
  known.</p>

  the abdominal pedicel is more imperfect than in any other ants. It is, indeed, very difficult to
  frame a definition that will include the Amblyoponides among ants, and at the same time separate
  Formicidae and Scoliidae. Forel considers the Amblyoponides to approach closely to certain
  divisions of the Scoliidae (Thynnides, <i>e.g.</i>). Little is known of these Insects, though they
  are widely distributed. <i>Amblyopone</i> is found in Australia and New Zealand; the allied genus
  <i>Stigmatomma</i> has a wide distribution, occurring even in Europe. The social life is believed
  to be imperfect, and the habits subterranean and sedentary. The males and females are winged; the

  <p><b>Association of Ants with other kinds of Insects.</b>&mdash;We have already alluded to the
  fact that a few species of ants are <span class="pagenum" id="page181"><span
  class="smaller">{181}</span></span>used by other species as attendants, and that the two kinds
  then live together quite amicably; and we have also seen that a few ants live in association with
  other species on terms that are not yet understood. One little ant, <i>Formicoxenus nitidulus</i>,
  lives only in the large nests of <i>Formica rufa</i>; these ants tolerate the little
  <i>Formicoxenus</i>, which so far as is known does them neither good nor harm. There are also a
  considerable number of species of small ants that are in the habit of choosing the neighbourhood
  of larger species for their dwelling-places; in some cases the nests are constructed actually
  within a portion of the edifice of the more powerful species, and the rule then appears to be that
  these neighbours do not molest one another. Notwithstanding the militant lives that many of them
  lead, ants cannot be considered as of generally ferocious disposition.</p>

  <p>But the most remarkable point in connection with their toleration consists in the fact that the
  nests of many species are inhabited by quite a colony of foreign Insects of various Orders; many
  of these, being found nowhere else, are spoken of as ants'-nest or Myrmecophilous Insects.<a
  id="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> The relations of ants with other Insects are of the
  most varied and complex character; some of their guests live with them on terms of the most
  intimate association, being indeed absolutely dependent for their existence on the good offices of
  their hosts; others of the ants'-nest Insects are enemies, while others are neutral or indifferent
  to the ants. We have already mentioned that the guests migrate in company with their hosts.</p>

  <p>Many species of ants derive a considerable portion of their sustenance from the sweet
  substances excreted by Aphidae. Ants may constantly be seen occupied with clusters of Aphidae, and
  it is said that the ingenious little creatures defend from enemies the manufacturers of the
  sweet-stuff they are so fond of, even going so far as to form barricades and covered places for
  the isolation and protection of this peculiar kind of cattle; a few ants keep some of the
  root-feeding Aphidae in their nests. Coccidae and other Homoptera, which also excrete much matter
  of a sugary nature, are likewise consorted with by ants; as are also the larvae of some
  butterflies of the family Lycaenidae; these latter being believed to furnish to the ants some
  substance of a nutritious kind.</p>

  <p>The Insects we have spoken of are, however, rather of the nature of ant-cattle, and the
  fondness of the ants for them is not very remarkable. The relations of the ants to the peculiar
  species of Insects that live only in or around their nests are much more extraordinary. The
  greater number of these guests belong to the Order Coleoptera, and of these there are many
  hundreds&mdash;probably many thousands&mdash;of species that depend on ants for their existence.
  The family Pselaphidae furnishes a large number of ants'-nest beetles, and it appears probable
  that most of them excrete some sugary substance of which the ants are fond. Many of these
  Pselaphidae are of the most fantastic shapes, more especially the members of the sub-family
  Clavigerides. But the most curious of all the ant's-nest beetles are the Paussidae, a family
  exclusively dependent on ants, and having the curious faculty, when disturbed, of
  bombarding&mdash;that is, of discharging a small quantity of vapour or liquid in a state of minute
  subdivision accompanied by a detonation. Many species of <i>Staphylinidae</i> are peculiar to
  ant's-nests, and most of them are indifferent or inimical to their hosts, but some of them, such
  as <i>Atemeles</i> (Fig. 82) and <i>Lomechusa</i>, are doubtless producers of sweet stuff that is
  liked by the ants. The ants feed some of their special favourites amongst these guests in the same
  manner as they feed one another, viz. by opening the mouth, causing a drop of liquid to appear on
  the lip, and remaining passive while the guest partakes of the proffered <i>bonne bouche</i>. This
  way of giving food to other individuals is a most remarkable feature in the character of ants; it
  is not the same system that they adopt in feeding the larvae, for they then make a series of
  actual movements, and force the nutriment into the mouths of the grubs. Besides the Insects we
  have mentioned there are also Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Poduridae and Thysanura, Acari, and small
  Isopod crustaceans that live exclusively in company with ants. We have mentioned that a few
  Hymenopterous and Dipterous parasites have been detected living at the expense of ants; it is
  probable that closer observation of the ant larvae and pupae in their nests <span class="pagenum"
  id="page183"><span class="smaller">{183}</span></span>will disclose a greater number of the
  parasites of this latter class.</p>

  <p>Much attention has been given to the relations between ants and their guests by Wasmann.<a
  id="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> He arranges them in four categories; 1, "Symphily"
  for the true guests, which are fed and tended by the ants, the guests often affording some
  substance the ants delight in; 2, "Metochy," the class of tolerated guests, being so far as is
  known not disagreeable to the hosts; 3, "Synecthry," including those Insects, etc., to which the
  ants are hostile, but which nevertheless maintain themselves in the midst of their foes; 4,
  Parasites, dwelling in the bodies of the adult, or of the young ants. Many of these ants'-nest
  Insects present a more or less perfect resemblance to the ants in one or more points, such as
  sculpture, colour, size, or form. To these resemblances Wasmann attaches great importance. We
  should, too, notice that some of the inquilines<a id="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
  have become acquainted with the movements and habits of the ants, and stroke them (as the ants do
  one another) to induce them to disgorge food in the manner we have alluded to. According to Janet,
  ants of the genus <i>Lasius</i> are infested by Acari of the genus <i>Antennophorus</i>. The ants
  carry the mites, which assume positions so as not to cause greater inconvenience than is
  inevitable. Moreover, the ants give food to the mites when requested, and behave in a most
  obliging way to them, though there is not any reason for supposing that in this case the ants
  derive any benefit from the Symphily.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The relations between ants and plants have been of late years much discussed. We
  have already briefly alluded to the subject when speaking of the Pseudomyrmini. We will here only
  remark that ants frequent plants not only for the purpose of securing the sweet stuff excreted by
  the Aphidae that live on them, but also for the sake of getting the sweet products the plants
  themselves afford. Mr. Aitken, speaking of ants in India, says: "I have come to the conclusion
  that one of the most important sources of food-supply which ants have is the sacchariferous glands
  to be found at the bases of so many leaves." It is supposed that the ants are on the whole
  beneficial to the plants that thus afford them supply; and this fact is considered by many to
  afford an adequate explanation of the existence of these interesting relations.</p>

    <p class="sp0"><i>Apparently wingless Insects when at rest, but really with four wings; the

    under the elytra. Mouth with mandibles; lower lip not divided along the middle. Metamorphosis

  <p>Coleoptera&mdash;or Beetles&mdash;are chiefly distinguished from other Insects by the solidity
  of their external integument, and by the peculiar nature of the first pair of their alar organs,
  which do not serve as instruments of flight, but as shells for protecting the upper face of the
  after-body, which, unlike the other parts, remains as a rule soft and membranous. These
  modifications of structure, though apparently slight, must be really extremely advantageous, for
  beetles are the predominant Order of Insects in the existing epoch. They depart from most other
  Insects in being less aerial in their habits; therefore, notwithstanding their enormous numbers,
  they do not meet the eye so frequently as flies, bees, or butterflies. The parts of the hard outer
  skeleton are beautifully fitted together, and as their modifications are easily appreciated they
  offer as fascinating a subject for study as do the skeletons of Vertebrata. The habits of beetles
  are so extremely varied that it is but little exaggeration to say that Coleoptera are to be found

  <p>The structure of the hard parts of the skeleton is of importance, as the classification of this
  enormous number of species is entirely based thereon; it will be readily understood from the
  accompanying diagram (Fig. 83). The general proportions of the chief parts of the body call for a
  few remarks. The prothorax is remarkably free, and is therefore capable of a much greater amount
  of movement independent of the after-body than it is in other Insects. The mesothorax is, on the
  other hand, much reduced; its chief function in the higher forms is to support the elytra, and to
  help to keep them together by means of its scutellum. The metathorax, on the contrary, is largely
  developed, except in the rather numerous forms that are entirely deprived of powers of flight. The
  composition of the abdomen has been a subject of great difference of opinion. Its upper surface is
  usually entirely covered by the elytra; the parts visible on the lower surface are called ventral
  segments, and are usually five in number. Although these five plates may constitute all that is
  superficially visible of the abdomen, yet if the elytra are taken off it is found that a larger
  number of segments&mdash;usually seven or eight&mdash;are visible on the dorsum. This seeming
  discrepancy of number between the <span class="pagenum" id="page186"><span
  class="smaller">{186}</span></span>dorsal and ventral plates is due to two facts; 1, that the hind
  coxae have a great and complex development, so that they conceal the true base of the venter,
  which, moreover, remains membranous to a greater or less extent, and thus allows much mobility,
  and at the same time a very accurate coadaptation between the hard parts of the venter and the
  metasternum<a id="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>; 2, that the terminal segments are
  withdrawn into the interior of the body, and are correspondingly much modified, the modification
  being greater in the case of the ventral than in that of the dorsal plates. The anatomy of the
  parts of the abdomen that are not externally visible has not been adequately studied by
  coleopterists, but Verhoeff has inaugurated a careful study of the comparative anatomy of the
  terminal segments<a id="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>; unfortunately, however, he has
  not so thoroughly studied the modifications at the base, and as it is not clear that these are so
  uniform as he has taken for granted, it is possible that his numbering of the segments may have to
  be in some cases modified. The retracted plates or segments are so intimately connected with the
  internal copulatory organs that it is no easy matter to interpret them. For the nomenclature of
  these parts we must refer the student to Verhoeff's later works. He considers the abdomen as
  composed of ten segments, the dorsal plates being demonstrable, while the tenth ventral plate is
  usually absent. The anal orifice is placed immediately beneath the tenth dorsal plate, and above
  the genital orifice, which lies behind and above the ninth ventral plate. Peytoureau admits a
  diversity in both the number of segments and the position of the orifice. These studies in
  comparative anatomy are surrounded with difficulties, and no morphological conclusions based on
  them can be considered as final until they have been confirmed by observation of the development
  of the parts.</p>

  <p>The elytra&mdash;or wing-cases&mdash;frequently have a remarkable sculpture, the use of which
  is unknown. According to Hofbauer there are between the outer and inner layers, glands secreting a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page187"><span class="smaller">{187}</span></span>fluid that reaches the
  surface through small pores. Hicks supposed that he detected nerve cells. Meinert is of opinion
  that the elytra correspond to the tegul&aelig; of Hymenoptera rather than to the wings of other Insects,
  but the little evidence that exists is not favourable to this view. The two elytra are usually, in
  repose, very perfectly fitted together by a complete coadaptation along the middle of the body, so
  that it is difficult to separate them; this line of junction is called the suture. There are forms
  in which the coadaptation is quite imperfect (Malacodermidae) and some in which it does not exist
  at all (<i>Melo&euml;</i>). The wings proper of beetles correspond to the posterior pair in other
  Insects, and are much more irregular in nervuration than those of most other Insects, correlative,
  it is supposed, with the folding they are subjected to in order to get them beneath the
  wing-cases. There are large numbers of species, genera, and groups of genera, all the members of
  which have the wings so much reduced in size as to be quite useless for purposes of flight. These
  forms are called apterous, though they are not really so, for the elytra (which are really the
  anterior wings) are present, and even the posterior wings are not truly absent in these cases,
  though they are sometimes so extremely rudimentary as to elude all but the most careful
  observation. The number of forms in which the elytra are absent is extremely small; this condition
  occurs only in the female sex; it is usually confined to cases in which the female is larva-like
  in form; but in the extraordinary Mediterranean Lamellicorn genus, <i>Pachypus</i>, the females
  are destitute of wings and elytra, though the anterior parts of the body are normally formed:
  these individuals live underground and rarely or never emerge. When the wings are absent the
  elytra are frequently soldered; that is to say, united together along the suture by some sort of
  secondary exudation; this union occurs in every degree of firmness, and appears to be variable in
  the individuals of one species; probably in accordance with the age of the individual. In most
  beetles the elytra are not only themselves closely connected, but are also very accurately
  coadapted with the sides of the body, except at the tip. Sometimes a coadaptation occurs between
  the tips of the elytra and the body, but not at the tip of the latter. In such cases one or more
  dorsal plates are left exposed: the last of such exposed dorsal plates is termed pygidium; a
  similar plate anterior to the pygidium is called propygidium.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page188"><span class="smaller">{188}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Larvae.</b>&mdash;Owing to the difficulty of rearing Coleoptera, less is perhaps known of
  their life-histories than of those of other Insects. They exhibit, however, extreme diversity
  correlative with the great specialisation of so many beetles to particular kinds of life. Most
  beetles must have exactly the right conditions to live in. The larvae of many forms are known.
  They are composed of a head, three thoracic segments (usually very distinct), and a number of
  abdominal segments varying from eight to ten. Coleopterous larvae are usually described as having
  nine abdominal segments; and it is but rarely that ten can be readily detected; they are, however,
  visible in various forms, as is the case in the form figured (Fig. 84). A great many of them
  possess a peculiar pseudopod at the underside of the body near or at the extremity; it can in many
  cases be entirely retracted into the body, and is generally described as being the protruded
  termination of the alimentary canal. Inspection of a series of larvae shows that it represents a
  body segment: it is sometimes armed with hooks. Three pairs of small thoracic legs are often
  present, but are very often completely absent. These thoracic legs may be present in the young
  larva, but not in the older (<i>Bruchus</i>). The usual number of spiracles is nine pairs, one
  prothoracic, eight abdominal; but this is subject to many exceptions, and mesothoracic and
  metathoracic stigmata are occasionally found. The figures we give in the following pages will
  enable the student to form some idea of the variety of form exhibited by beetle larvae.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Pupation usually takes place in a cavity in the earth, or near the feeding-place, but a great
  many species form a cocoon, composed either of fragments of earth or of wood, and slightly
  cemented together. A few suspend themselves by the tail after the manner of butterfly caterpillars
  (Cassididae, Coccinellidae). The pupae are usually extremely soft, their appendages not being
  fastened to the body. But some pupae (Staphylinides) are truly obtected, having a hard shell and
  the rudimentary appendages fastened by exudation to the body, like Lepidopterous pupae, and others
  (Coccinellidae) are intermediate <span class="pagenum" id="page189"><span
  class="smaller">{189}</span></span>between this state and the normal soft pupa. The pupal state
  lasts but a short time, from one to three weeks being the usual period. The perfect Insect is at
  first soft and almost colourless, and it is often some days before it attains its complete
  coloration and hardness.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;Owing to the hardness of the skeleton, beetles shrivel but little
  after death, so that the form and relations of the various sclerites can usually be detected with
  ease. These sclerites seem to be remarkably constant (except in the case of sexual distinctions)
  within the limits of each species, and are very useful for the formation of genera and groups of
  genera; but they vary so much outside the limits mentioned that it is very difficult to make use
  of them for defining the larger groups. Hence it is not easy to frame accurate definitions of the
  families, and still less so to arrange these families in more comprehensive series. The natural
  difficulty has been much increased by the habit coleopterists have of framing their definitions on
  what is visible without the aid of dissection. Nevertheless considerable progress has been made.
  We are obliged at present to adopt upwards of eighty families; and we are able to distinguish on
  positive characters five series; this leaves a large number of forms still unclassified, and these
  we have here associated as a sixth series, which we have called Coleoptera Polymorpha. This series
  corresponds with the two series called in books Clavicornia and Serricornia. As it is admitted to
  be impossible to define these two series, we think it much better to act accordingly, and to
  establish for the present a great group that can only be characterised by the fact that its
  members do not belong to any of the other five series. No doubt a larger knowledge of development,
  coupled with the advance of comparative anatomy, will ultimately bring about a better state of
  affairs. The Strepsiptera, with one family Stylopidae, are only provisionally included among the
  Coleoptera. These six series are fairly equal as regards extent. Though the Polymorpha includes
  the larger number of forms, yet a large part of them belong to four great families (Staphylinidae,
  Buprestidae, Elateridae, Malacodermidae), which are easily recognisable, so that the number of
  unmanageable forms is not really great. Indeed, an acquaintance with the external anatomy of two
  or three dozen species, selected as typical, would enable a student to classify <span
  class="pagenum" id="page190"><span class="smaller">{190}</span></span>with tolerable certainty the
  vast majority of species that he would subsequently meet with.</p>

  not so widely different from that of other Coleoptera. The larvae live on decaying vegetable

  bodies, the last two segments being of larger size than usual. Many of them possess organs of
  stridulation, and the structure of their spiracles is very peculiar, each one being more or less
  completely surrounded by a chitinous plate. The spiracles usually form a system entirely closed,
  except at the moment when the skin is shed and the tracheal exuviae are detached. Meinert<a
  id="NtA_79" href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> considers these spiracles to be organs of hearing.

  or five hundred species of this family known; they are usually shining-black, unattractive

  absent from Europe, and there is only one species in the United States of North America. The
  larvae are very interesting, from the fact that they appear to have only four legs. This arises
  from the posterior pair being present only as very short processes, the function of which is to
  scrape striated areas on the preceding pair of legs and so produce sound. In the species figured
  (Fig. 86) this short leg is a paw-like structure, bearing several hard digits; but in other
  species it is more simple, and without the digits. The perfect Insect has no sound-producing
  organs, and it is very remarkable therefore to find the larvae <span class="pagenum"

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Lucanidae</b> (<i>Stag-beetles</i>).&mdash;<i>Labrum indistinct, fixed; mentum not
  excised; antennae not curled in repose, with but little coadaptation of the terminal joints; the
  elytra entirely cover the dorsal surface of the abdomen.</i> The Stag-beetles are well known on
  account of the extraordinary development of the mandibles in the male sex, these organs being in
  some cases nearly as long as the whole of the rest of the Insect, and armed with projections or
  teeth that give the Insects a most formidable appearance. So far as we have been able to discover,
  these structures are put to very little use, and in many cases are not capable of being of service
  even as weapons of offence. The males are usually very much larger than the females, and are
  remarkable on account of the great variation in the stature of different individuals of the same
  species; correlative with these distinctions of individual size we find extreme differences in the
  development of the head and mandibles. Moreover, the small male specimens exhibit not merely
  reductions in the size of the mandibles, but also show considerable differences in the form of
  these parts, due, in some cases, apparently to the fact that only when a certain length of the
  mandible is attained is there any development of certain of the minor projections: in other cases
  it is not possible to adopt this view, as the small mandibles bear as many projections as the
  large forms do, or even more. In each species these variations fall, in the majority of cases,
  into distinct states, so that entomologists describe them as "forms," the largest developments
  being called teleodont, the smallest priodont; the terms mesodont and amphiodont being applied to
  intermediate states. Leuthner, who has examined many specimens, states that in <i>Odontolabis
  sinensis</i>, no intermediates between the teleodont and mesodont forms occur, and as the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page194"><span class="smaller">{194}</span></span>two forms are very different
  they are liable to be mistaken for distinct species.</p>

  <p>There are at present between 500 and 600 species of stag-beetles known; the Indo-Malayan and
  Austro-Malayan regions being richest in them. Australia possesses many remarkable and aberrant
  forms. In the Ceratognathini&mdash;a group well represented in New Zealand as well as in
  Australia&mdash;the structure of the antennae is like that of the Scarabaeidae, rather than of the
  Lucanidae. The most aberrant form known is, however, our common <i>Sinodendron cylindricum</i>;
  this departs in numerous features from other Lucanidae, and instead of the mandibles of the male
  being more largely developed, there is a horn on the head; it is very doubtful whether this Insect
  should be allowed to remain in the family. Little is known of the habits and development of
  Lucanid&aelig;, except in the case of three or four species that are common in Europe.</p>

  <p>The common stag-beetle, <i>Lucanus cervus</i>, is our largest British beetle. The larva much
  resembles that of <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, but attains a larger size, and the anal aperture is
  placed longitudinally instead of transversely; it lives in decaying wood, or eats the roots of
  trees without being injurious; its life in this state lasts about four years; the pupal period is
  passed through rapidly, and the perfect Insect may remain for months underground before it becomes
  active; this occurs in June and July. This larva stridulates by scraping certain hard tubercular
  ridges on the third pair of legs, over a specially adapted rough area at the base of the second
  pair.</p>

  <p>The Passalidae and Lucanidae are united by some authorities as a group called Pectinicornia;
  the term Lamellicornia being then confined to the Scarabaeidae. The Passalidae appear, however, to
  be really more nearly allied to the Scarabaeidae than to the Lucanidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Scarabaeidae</b> (<i>Chafers</i>).&mdash;<i>The leaflets of the antennae are well
  coadapted, and are susceptible of separation. The elytra <span class="pagenum" id="page195"><span
  class="smaller">{195}</span></span>usually leave the pygidium uncovered. The number of visible
  ventral segments is usually six, or at the sides seven, not five, as in Lucanidae and
  Passalidae.</i> This is one of the most important families of Insects. About 13,000 species are
  already known; as some of them are highly remarkable creatures on account of the males being armed
  with horns, they are figured in many works on natural history. There is great variety of form, and
  the following five sub-families may be adopted, though authorities are by no means agreed as to
  the classification of this extensive family, which, moreover, be it remarked, is increasing by the
  discovery of about 300 new species every year.</p>

  <p>i. The Coprides form an immense group of about 5000 species; they differ somewhat in habits
  from other Lamellicorns, inasmuch as most of them live on dung, or decaying animal matter; the
  sub-family connects with the Lucanidae, so far as superficial characters go, by means of two of
  its groups, Trogini and Nicagini, the latter being very near to the Ceratognathini in Lucanidae.
  So little is known as to the morphology and development of these groups that it is not possible to
  pronounce an opinion as to the validity of this apparent alliance. <i>Trox</i> stridulates by
  rubbing two raised lines on the penultimate dorsal segment across two striate ribs on the inner
  face of the elytra; <i>Geotrupes</i>, on the other hand, produces an audible sound by rubbing
  together a file on the posterior coxa and a fine ridge on the contiguous ventral segment. The
  larva in this genus has a different organ <span class="pagenum" id="page196"><span
  class="smaller">{196}</span></span>for stridulation from the imago; it is placed on the second and
  third pairs of legs, the latter pair being much reduced in size.</p>

  <p>The most interesting division of the Coprides is the group Scarabaeini. No member of this group
  inhabits the British islands, but in Southern Europe, and in still warmer lands, these Insects are
  well known from the curious habit many of the species have of rolling about balls of dung and
  earth. The long hind legs are chiefly used for this purpose, and it is on the peculiar structure
  of these limbs that the group has been established. Many of the stone Scarabaei found in Egyptian
  tombs represent some kind of Scarabaeini, and it has been said that the ancient Egyptians looked
  on these Insects as sacred because of their movements. These must certainly appear very strange to
  those who see them and are unacquainted with their object. It is stated that the dwellers in the
  valley of the Nile thought the actions of these Insects, when rolling their balls, were typical of
  the planetary and lunar revolutions; and that the sudden appearance of the beetles after a period
  of complete absence was emblematic of a future life. Many accounts have been given of the habits
  of members of this group, but according to Fabre all are more or less erroneous; and he has
  described the habits and life-history of <i>Scarabaeus sacer</i> (Fig. 89), as observed by him in
  Southern France. These Insects act the part of scavengers by breaking up and burying the droppings
  of cattle and other animals. The female <i>Scarabaeus</i> detaches a portion of the dung and forms
  it into a ball, sometimes as large as the fist; this it rolls along by means of its hind legs, by
  pushing when necessary with its broad head, or by walking backwards and dragging the ball with its
  front legs. The strength and patience displayed by the creature in the execution of this task are
  admirable. Frequently the owner of this small spherical property is joined, so Fabre informs us,
  by a friend, who is usually of the same sex and assists her in pushing along the ball till a
  suitable place is reached. When this is attained, the owner commences to excavate a chamber for
  the reception of the ball; sometimes the false friend takes advantage of the opportunity thus
  offered and carries off the ball for her own use. Should no disappointment of this sort occur, the
  <i>Scarabaeus</i> accomplishes the burying of the ball in its subterranean chamber, and
  accompanies it for the purpose of devouring it; the feast is continued without intermission till
  the food is entirely <span class="pagenum" id="page197"><span
  class="smaller">{197}</span></span>exhausted, when the <i>Scarabaeus</i> seeks a fresh store of
  provender to be treated in a similar manner. According to M. Fabre's account these events occur in
  the spring of the year, and when the hot weather sets in the <i>Scarabaeus</i> passes through a
  period of quiescence, emerging again in the autumn to recommence its labours, which are now,
  however, directed immediately to the continuance of the species; a larger subterranean chamber is
  formed, and to this retreat the beetle carries dung till it has accumulated a mass of the size of
  a moderate apple; this material is carefully arranged, previous to the laying of the egg, in such
  a manner that the grub to be hatched from the egg shall find the softest and most nutritive
  portions close to it, while the coarser and more innutritious parts are arranged so as to be
  reached by the grub only after it has acquired some strength; lastly, a still more delicate and
  nutritive paste is prepared by the mother beetle for a first meal for the newly-hatched grub, by
  some of the food being submitted to a partial digestion in her organs; finally, the egg is
  deposited in the selected spot, and the chamber closed. Certain of the Coprides exhibit, according
  to Fabre, some extremely exceptional features in their life-histories. The mother, instead of
  dying after oviposition, survives, and sees the growth of her young to the perfect state, and then
  produces another generation. No similar case can be pointed out in Insects, except in the Social
  kinds; but from these the Coprides observed by Fabre differ profoundly, inasmuch as the number of
  eggs produced by the mother is extremely small; <i>Copris hispanus</i>, for instance, producing in
  each of its acts of oviposition only one, two, or three eggs.</p>

  <p>ii. The Melolonthides are probably almost as numerous as the Coprides, some 4000 species being
  already known. The larvae are believed to feed chiefly on roots. <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, the
  common cockchafer, is very abundant in some parts of Europe, and owing to this and to the great
  damage it causes, has attracted much attention. The memoir by Straus-Durckheim<a id="NtA_82"
  href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> on its anatomy is one of the classical works of Entomology. This
  Insect is so injurious in some parts of France that money is paid by the local authorities for its
  destruction. M. Reiset informs us that under this arrangement 867,173,000 perfect cockchafers, and
  647,000,000 larvae were destroyed in the Seine-inf&eacute;rieure in the four years from the middle of
  1866 to 1870. Unlike the Coprides, the larval life in Melolonthides is prolonged, and that of the
  imago is of brief duration. In Central Europe the life-cycle of the individual in <i>M.
  vulgaris</i> occupies three years, though in dry periods it may be extended to four years. In
  Scandinavia the time occupied by the development appears to be usually five years. The fertile
  female enters the ground and deposits its eggs in two or three successive batches of about fifteen
  each. The eggs swell as the development of the embryo progresses; the larva emerges about five
  weeks after the eggs have been deposited, and is of relatively large size. When young the larvae
  can straighten themselves out and crawl, but when older they lose this power, and when above
  ground rest helplessly on their sides. In the winter they descend deeply into the earth to protect
  themselves from frost. The pupa state lasts only a few days, but after the final transformation
  the perfect Insect may remain motionless for as much as eight months underground before commencing
  its active life in the air.<a id="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> In the perfect state
  the Insect is sometimes injurious from the large quantity of foliage it destroys. Schi&ouml;dte<a
  id="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> considered that these larvae (and those of numerous
  other Scarabaeidae) stridulate by rubbing certain projections on the stipes of the maxilla against
  the under-surface of the mandible. These surfaces appear, however, but little adapted for the
  purpose of producing sound.</p>

  <p>iii. The Rutelides number about 1500 species; there are many <span class="pagenum"
  id="page199"><span class="smaller">{199}</span></span>Insects of brilliant metallic colours
  amongst them, but very little is known as to their life-histories. The larvae are very much like
  those of Melolonthides.</p>

  <p>iv. The Dynastides are the smallest division in number of species, there being scarcely 1000
  known; but amongst them we find in the genera <i>Dynastes</i> and <i>Megasoma</i> some of the
  largest of existing Insects. The horns and projections on the heads and prothoraces of some of the
  males of these Insects are truly extraordinary, and it does not appear possible to explain their
  existence by any use they are to their possessors. These structures are but little used for
  fighting. Baron von H&uuml;gel informs the writer that in Java he has observed large numbers of
  <i>Xylotrupes gideon</i>; he noticed that the males sometimes carry the females by the aid of
  their horns; but this must be an exceptional case, for the shape of these instruments, in the
  majority of Dynastides, would not allow of their being put to this use. The development of these
  horns varies greatly in most of the species, but he did not find that the females exhibited any
  preference for the highly armed males. The fact that the males are very much larger than the
  females, and that the armature is usually confined to them, suggests, however, that some sexual
  reason exists for these remarkable projections. Many Dynastides possess organs of stridulation,
  consisting of lines of sculpture placed so as to form one or two bands on the middle of the
  propygidium, and brought into play by being rubbed by the extremities of the wing-cases. This
  apparatus is of a less perfect nature than the structures for the same purpose found in numerous
  other beetles. We have no member of this sub-family in Britain, and there are scarcely a dozen in
  all Europe. Decaying vegetable matter is believed to be the nutriment of Dynastides. The European
  <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i> is sometimes found in numbers in spent tan. The growth and development
  of the individual is believed to be but slow.</p>

  <p class="sp3">v. The Cetoniides are renowned for the beauty of their colours and the elegance of
  their forms; hence they are a favourite group, and about 1600 species have been catalogued. They
  are specially fond of warm regions, but it is a peculiarity of the sub-family that a large
  majority of the species are found in the Old World; South America is inexplicably poor in these
  Insects, notwithstanding its extensive forests. In this sub-family the mode of flight is peculiar;
  the elytra do not extend down the <span class="pagenum" id="page200"><span
  class="smaller">{200}</span></span>sides of the body, so that, if they are elevated a little, the
  wings can be protruded. This is the mode of flight adopted by most Cetoniides, but the members of
  the group Trichiini fly in the usual manner. In Britain we have only four kinds of Cetoniides;
  they are called Rose-chafers. The larvae of <i>C. floricola</i> and some other species live in
  ants' nests made of vegetable refuse, and it is said that they eat the ants' progeny. Two North
  American species of <i>Euphoria</i> have similar habits. The group Cremastochilini includes
  numerous peculiar Insects that apparently have still closer relations with ants. Most of them are
  very aberrant as well as rare forms, and it has been several times observed in North America that
  species of <i>Cremastochilus</i> not only live in the nests of the ants, but are forcibly detained
  therein by the owners, who clearly derive some kind of satisfaction from the companionship of the
  beetles. The species of the genus <i>Lomaptera</i> stridulate in a peculiar manner, by rubbing the
  edges of the hind femora over a striate area on the ventral segments.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series II. Adephaga or Caraboidea.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>All the tarsi five-jointed; antennae filiform, or nearly so; mouth-parts
    highly developed, the outer lobe of the maxilla nearly always divided into a two-jointed palpus;
    supports of the labial palpi developed as joints of the palpi, and in some cases approximate at
    their bases. Abdomen with the exposed segments one more in number at the sides than along the
    middle, the number being usually five along the middle, six at each side.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>This extensive series includes the tiger-beetles, ground-beetles, and true water-beetles; it
  consists of six families, and forms a natural assemblage. It is sometimes called Carnivora or
  Filicornia. The exceptions to the characters we have mentioned are but few. The supports of the
  labial palpi are frequently covered by the mentum, and then the palpi appear three-jointed; but
  when the joint-like palpiger is not covered these palps appear four-jointed. As a rule,
  approximation of these supports is indicative of high development. In some of the lower forms the
  trophi remain at a lower stage of development than is usual. This is especially the case with the
  genus <i>Amphizoa</i>, which forms of <span class="pagenum" id="page201"><span
  class="smaller">{201}</span></span>itself the family Amphizoidae. The Bombardier-beetles make an
  exception as regards the abdominal structure, for in some of them no less than eight segments are
  visible, either along the middle line or at the sides of the venter. In Hydroporides (one of the
  divisions of Dytiscidae) the front and middle feet have each only four joints. Many naturalists
  unite the Gyrinidae with the Adephaga, and a few also associate with them the Paussidae and
  Rhysodidae; but we think it better at present to exclude all these, though we believe that both
  Paussidae and Rhysodidae will ultimately be assigned to the series. The larvae are usually very
  active, and have a higher development of the legs than is usual in this Order. Their tarsi possess
  two claws.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Cicindelidae</b> (<i>Tiger-beetles</i>).&mdash;<i>Clypeus extending laterally in
  front of the insertion of the antennae. Lower lip with the palpi usually greatly developed, but
  with the ligula and paraglossae very much reduced, often scarcely to be detected. Maxillae with
  the outer lobe forming a two-jointed palp,<a id="NtA_85" href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> the
  inner lobe elongate, furnished at the tip with a hook-like process, which is usually articulated
  by a joint with the lobe itself.</i> The tiger-beetles are very active Insects, running with
  extreme speed, and sometimes flying in a similar manner; they are all predaceous, and amongst the
  most voracious and fierce of the carnivorous beetles, so that they well deserve their name. Bates,
  speaking of the Amazonian <i>Megacephala</i>, says "their powers of running exceed anything I have
  ever observed in this style of Insect locomotion; they run in a serpentine course over the smooth
  sand, and when closely pursued by the hand they are apt to turn suddenly back and thus baffle the
  most practised hand and eye." He further says that the species he observed (being of diverse
  colours) agreed in colour with the general colours of the "locale they inhabit." The larvae of
  Cicindelidae live in deep burrows, sinking more or less vertically into the ground, and in these
  they take up a peculiar position, for which their shape is specially adapted; the head and
  prothorax are broad, the rest of the body slender, the fifth segment of the abdomen is furnished
  on the back with a pair of strong hooks; the ocelli on the sides of the head are very perfect.
  Supporting itself at the top of the burrow by means of these hooks and of its terminal tube, the
  larva blocks the mouth of the burrow with its large head and prothorax, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page202"><span class="smaller">{202}</span></span>in this position waits for its prey. This
  consists of Insects that may alight on the spot or run over it. When an Insect ventures within
  reach, the head of the larva is thrown back with a rapid jerk, the prey is seized by the long
  sharp mandibles, dragged to the bottom of the burrow and devoured. The burrows are often more than
  a foot deep, and are said to be excavated by the larva itself, which carries up the earth on the
  shovel-like upper surface of its head. The female tiger-beetle is endowed with powerful and
  elongate excavating instruments at the termination of the body, and it is probable that when
  placing the egg in the earth she facilitates the future operations of the larva by forming the
  outlines of the burrow. Extremely few larvae of Cicindelidae are known, but they all exhibit the
  type of structure mentioned above, and apparently have similar habits. Our little British
  <i>Cicindela</i>, most of which are so active on the wing, agree in these respects with the
  African species of <i>Manticora</i>, which are entirely apterous, and are the largest of the
  Cicindelidae. P&eacute;ringuey found a breeding-ground of <i>M. tuberculata</i> near Kimberley; the
  larvae were living in the usual Cicindelid manner; but the ground was so hard that he was not able
  to investigate the burrows, and there were but few Insects that could serve as food in the
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Tiger-beetles display considerable variety of structure, especially as regards the mouth, which
  exhibits very remarkable developments of the palpi and labrum (Fig. 91). The tiger-beetles, like
  most other Insects that capture living prey, do not consume their victims entire, but subsist
  chiefly on the juices they squeeze out of them; the hard and innutritious parts are rejected after
  the victim has been thoroughly lacerated and squeezed; the mouth forms both trap and press; the
  palpi spread out in order to facilitate the rapid engulfing of a victim, then close up under it
  and help to support it in the mouth; while the labrum above closes the cavity in the other
  direction. The mouth itself is a large cavity communicating very freely with the exterior, but so
  completely shut off from the following parts of the alimentary canal that it is difficult to find
  the orifice of communication; the labium being much modified to form the posterior wall. For the
  capture of the prey, always living but of various kinds, a mechanism with great holding power and
  capable of rapid action is required. The mouth of the terrestrial <i>Manticora</i> (Fig. 91, B),
  exhibits great strength; some of the chitinous parts are extremely thick, the mandibles are
  enormous, the palpi, however, are comparatively low in development. In the arboreal genus
  <i>Pogonostoma</i> the palpary structures (Fig. 91, A) attain a development scarcely equalled
  elsewhere in the Insect world. The great majority of the Cicindelidae are inhabitants of the
  warmer, or of the tropical regions of the world, and very little is known as to their
  life-histories; they show great diversity in their modes of hunting their prey. Some are wingless;
  others are active on the wing; and of both of these divisions there are forms that are found only
  on trees or bushes. Some, it is believed, frequent only the mounds of Termites. The characteristic
  feature common <span class="pagenum" id="page204"><span class="smaller">{204}</span></span>to all
  is great activity and excessive wariness. The genus <i>Pogonostoma</i>, to which we have already
  alluded, is confined to Madagascar, where the species are numerous, but are rare in collections on
  account of the difficulty of securing them. Raffray informs us that certain species frequent the
  trunks of trees, up which they run in a spiral manner on the least alarm. The only way he could
  obtain specimens was by the aid of an assistant; the two approached a tree very quietly from
  opposite sides, and when near it, made a rush, and joined hands as high up the trunk as they
  could, so as to embrace the tree, when the <i>Pogonostoma</i> fell to the ground and was
  captured.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Carabidae</b> (<i>Ground-beetles</i>).&mdash;<i>Clypeus not extending laterally in
  front of the antennae. Maxillae with the outer lobe destitute of an articulated hook at the tip.
  Antennae covered (except the basal joints) with a minute pubescence. Hind legs not very different
  from the middle pair, formed for running, as usual in beetles.</i> This is one of the largest and
  most important of the families of Coleoptera, including as it does 12,000 or 13,000 described
  species. In this country Carabidae are nearly entirely terrestrial in habits, and are scarcely
  ever seen on the wing; many of the species indeed have merely rudimentary wings; in the tropics
  there are, however, many arboreal forms that take wing with more or less alertness. The larvae
  (Fig. 92, A) are usually elongate in form and run freely; they may be known by their tarsi ending
  in two claws, by the exserted, sharp, calliper-like mandibles, by the body ending in two processes
  (sometimes jointed) and a tube of varying length projecting backwards. The pupae usually have the
  hind pair of legs so arranged that the tips of the tarsi project behind, beyond the extremity of
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page205"><span class="smaller">{205}</span></span>body. The
  Carabidae are carnivorous and predaceous both as larvae and perfect Insects; they attack living
  Insects, worms, or other small, soft creatures, but do not disdain dead specimens. Some species of
  <i>Carabus</i>, found in North Africa where snails abound, are specially formed for attacking
  these molluscs, having the head long and slender so that it can be thrust into the shell of the
  snail. A few species have been detected eating growing corn, and even the young seeds of some
  Umbelliferae; these belong chiefly to the genera <i>Harpalus</i>, <i>Zabrus</i>, and <i>Amara</i>.
  Some species of the abundant genera <i>Pterostichus</i> and <i>Harpalus</i>, are said to be fond
  of ripe strawberries. The most anomalous forms of Carabidae are the Pseudomorphides, a sub-family
  almost peculiar to Australia, the members of which live under bark, and have but little
  resemblance to other Carabids owing to their compact forms and continuous outlines. The genus
  <i>Mormolyce</i> is one of the wonders of the Insect world on account of the extraordinary shape
  of its members; the sides of the elytra form large crinkled expansions, and the head is unusually
  elongate. These Insects live on the underside of fallen trees in the Malay Archipelago and
  Peninsula; no reason whatever can be at present assigned for their remarkable shape.</p>

  <p>There are a considerable number of blind members of this family: some of them live in caverns;
  these belong chiefly to the genus <i>Anophthalmus</i>, species of which have been detected in the
  caves of the Pyrenees, of Austria, and of North America. It has been shown that the optic nerves
  and lobes, as well as the external organs of vision, are entirely wanting in some of these cave
  Carabidae; the tactile setae have, however, a larger development than usual, and the Insects are
  as skilful in running as if they possessed eyes. <i>Anophthalmus</i> is closely related to our
  British genus <i>Trechus</i>, the species of which are very much given to living in deep crevices
  in the earth, or under large stones, and have some of them very small eyes. In addition to these
  cavernicolous <i>Anophthalmus</i>, other blind Carabidae have been discovered during recent years
  in various parts of the world, where they live under great stones deeply embedded in the earth;
  these blind lapidicolous Carabidae are of extremely minute size and of most sluggish habits; the
  situations in which they are found suggest that many successive generations are probably passed
  under the same stone. Not a single specimen has ever been found above ground. The minute <span
  class="pagenum" id="page206"><span class="smaller">{206}</span></span>Carabids of the genus
  <i>A&euml;pus</i>, that pass a large part of their lives under stones below high-water mark (emerging
  only when the tide uncovers them), on the borders of the English Channel and elsewhere, are very
  closely allied to these blind Insects, and have themselves only very small eyes, which, moreover,
  according to Hammond and Miall, are covered in larger part by a peculiar shield.<a id="NtA_87"
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> A few Carabidae, of the genera <i>Glyptus</i> and
  <i>Orthogonius</i>, are believed to live in the nests of Termites. Savage found the larva of <i>G.
  sculptilis</i> in the nests of <i>Termes bellicosus</i>; it has been described by Horn, and is
  said to bear so great a resemblance to young queens of the Termites as to have been mistaken for
  them.<a id="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> Mr. Haviland found <i>Rhopalomelus
  angusticollis</i> in Termites' nests in South Africa. P&eacute;ringuey states that it emits a very strong
  and disagreeable odour. It is probable that it preys on the Termites, and this also is believed to
  be the habit of the Ceylonese <i>Helluodes taprobanae</i>. Some species of the Mediterranean genus
  <i>Siagona</i> stridulate by means of a file on the under surface of the prothorax, rubbed by a
  striate area, adapted in form, on the anterior femora.</p>

  <p>A valuable memoir on the classification of this important family is due to the late Dr. G. H.
  Horn;<a id="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> he arranges Carabidae in three sub-families;
  we think it necessary to add a fourth for <i>Mormolyce</i>:</p>

    <p class="sp0">3. Middle coxal cavities attained on the outside by the tips of the epimera, but
    not by those of the episterna. .......... Sub-fam. 1. Carabides.</p>
  </div>

  <p>These four sub-families are of extremely different extent and nature. The Harpalides are the
  dominant forms, and include upwards of 10,000 known species; while the various tribes into which
  the sub-family is divided include, as a rule, each many <span class="pagenum" id="page207"><span
  class="smaller">{207}</span></span>genera; the Carabides are next in importance, with upwards of
  2000 species, but are divided into a comparatively large number of tribes, each of which averages
  a much smaller number of genera than do the tribes of Harpalides; Pseudomorphides includes only
  about 100 species; and Mormolycides consists of the single genus <i>Mormolyce</i> with three
  species.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Amphizoidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Antennae destitute of pubescence: outer lobe of maxilla
  not jointed; metasternum with a short transverse impressed line on the middle behind. Hind legs
  slender, not formed for swimming.</i> This family is limited to the genus <i>Amphizoa</i>; the
  species of which may be briefly described as lowly organised Carabidae that lead an aquatic life.
  The geographical distribution is highly remarkable, there being but three species, two of which
  live in Western North America, the third in Eastern Tibet. The habits of American <i>Amphizoa</i>
  are known; they pass a life of little activity in very cold, rapid streams; they do not swim, but
  cling to stones and timber. The larva was recently discovered in Utah by Messrs. Hubbard and
  Schwarz:<a id="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> it has the same habits as the perfect
  Insect, and in general form resembles the larvae of the genus <i>Carabus</i>; but it has no
  terminal tube to the body, the abdomen consisting of eight segments and a pair of short terminal
  appendages; the spiracles are obsolete, with the exception of a pair placed near to one another at
  the termination of the eighth abdominal segment. As regards the mouth this larva is Carabid, as
  regards the abdomen and stigmata Dytiscid of a primitive type.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Pelobiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Antennae destitute of pubescence: outer lobe of maxilla
  jointed, metasternum with a short transverse impressed line on the middle behind. Hind legs rather
  slender, formed for swimming, the tarsi longer than the tibiae.</i> This family is limited to the
  one genus <i>Pelobius</i> (<i>Hygrobia</i> of some authors). Like <i>Amphizoa</i>, to which it is
  in several respects analogous, it has a singular geographical distribution; there are only four
  known species, one lives in Britain and the Mediterranean region, one in Chinese Tibet, two in
  Australia. <i>Pelobius</i> may be briefly described as a Carabid adapted to a considerable extent
  for living in and swimming about in water; differing thus from <i>Amphizoa</i>, which has no
  special adaptation for swimming. The larva of <i>Pelobius</i> is remarkable; it breathes by means
  of branchial filaments on the under surface of the body, the spiracles being present, though those
  of the abdomen are very minute and the others small. The head is very large, the mandibles are not
  tube-like, the food being taken after the manner of the Carabidae; the 8th abdominal segment ends
  in three long processes; the small 9th segment is retracted beneath them. The adult <i>Pelobius
  tardus</i> is remarkable for its loud stridulation. The sound is produced by an apparatus
  described correctly by Charles Darwin;<a id="NtA_91" href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page209"><span class="smaller">{209}</span></span>there is a file on the

  transverse line; posterior coxae prolonged as plates, covering a large part of the lower surface
  of the abdomen; the slender, but clubbed, hind femora move between these plates and the

  in length. The ventral plates are peculiar to the Insects of this family, but their function is
  not known. The larvae are remarkable on account of the fleshy processes disposed on their bodies;
  but they exhibit considerable variety in this respect; their mandibles are grooved so that they
  suck their prey. In the larva of <i>Haliplus</i>, according to Schi&ouml;dte, there are eight pairs of
  abdominal spiracles, but in <i>Cnemidotus</i> (Fig. 95, B), there are no spiracles, and air is
  obtained by means of a trachea traversing each of the long filaments. The Insects of these two
  genera are so similar in the imaginal instar that it is well worthy of note that their larvae
  should be distinguished by such important characters. Haliplidae is a small family consisting of
  three genera, having about 100 species; <span class="pagenum" id="page210"><span

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Dytiscidae</b> (<i>Water-beetles</i>).&mdash;<i>Antennae bare; hind legs formed for

  palpus.</i> The Dytiscidae, or true water-beetles, are of interest because&mdash;unlike the
  aquatic Neuroptera&mdash;they exist in water in both the larval and imaginal instars; nevertheless
  there is reason for supposing that they are modified terrestrial Insects: these reasons are (1)
  that in their general organisation they are similar to the Carabidae, and they drown more quickly
  than the majority of land beetles do; (2) though the larvae are very different from the larvae of
  terrestrial beetles, yet the imaginal instars are much less profoundly changed, and are capable of
  existing perfectly well on land, and of taking prolonged flights through the air; (3) the pupa is,
  so far as known, always terrestrial. The larvae and imagos are perfectly at home in the water,
  except that they must come to the surface to get air. Some of them are capable, however, when
  quiescent, of living for hours together beneath the water, but there appears to be great diversity
  in this respect.<a id="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> The hind pair of legs is the
  chief means of locomotion. These swimming-legs (Fig. 97) are deserving of admiration on account of
  their mechanical perfection; this, however, is exhibited in various <span class="pagenum"

  <p>The wing-cases fit perfectly to the body, except at the tip, so as to form an air-tight space
  between themselves and the back of the Insect; this space is utilised as a reservoir for air. When
  the <i>Dytiscus</i> feels the necessity for air it rises to the surface and exposes the tip of the
  body exactly at the level of the water, separating at the same time the abdomen from the
  wing-cases so as to open a broad chink at the spot where the parts were, during the Insect's
  submersion, so well held together as to be air- and water-tight. The terminal two pairs of
  spiracles are much enlarged, and by curving the abdomen the beetle brings them into contact with
  the atmosphere; respiration is effected by this means as well as by the store of air carried about
  under the wing cases.  The air that enters the space between the elytra and body is shut in there
  when the Insect closes the chink and again dives beneath the water. The enlargement of the
  terminal stigmata in <i>Dytiscus</i> is exceptional, and in forms more highly organised in other
  respects, such as <i>Cybister</i>, these spiracles remain minute; the presumption being that in
  this case respiration is carried on almost entirely by means of the supply the Insect carries in
  the space between the elytra and the base of the abdomen.<a id="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> The structure of the front foot of the male <i>Dytiscus</i>, and
  of many other water-beetles, is highly remarkable, the foot being dilated to form a palette or
  saucer, covered beneath by sucker-like structures of great delicacy and beauty; by the aid of
  these the male is enabled to retain a position on the female for many hours, or even days,
  together. Lowne has shown that the <span class="pagenum" id="page212"><span
  class="smaller">{212}</span></span>suckers communicate with a sac in the interior of the foot
  containing fluid, which exudes under pressure. As the portions of the skeleton of the female on
  which these suckers are brought to bear is frequently covered with pores, or minute pits, it is
  probable that some correlation between the two organisms is brought about by these structures. The
  females in many groups of Dytiscidae bear on the upper surface of the body a peculiar sculpture of
  various kinds, the exact use of which is unknown; in many species there are two forms of the
  female, one possessing this peculiar sculpture, the other nearly, or quite, without it. The larvae
  of Dytiscidae differ from those of Carabidae chiefly by the structure of the mouth and of the
  abdomen. They are excessively rapacious, and are indeed almost constantly engaged in sucking the
  juices of soft and small aquatic animals, by no means excluding their own kind. The mode of
  suction is not thoroughly known, but so far as the details have been ascertained they are
  correctly described, in the work on aquatic Insects, by Professor Miall, we have previously
  referred to; the mandibles are hollow, with a hole near the tip and another at the base, and being
  sharp at the tips are thrust into the body of a victim, and then by their closure the other parts
  of the mouth, which are very beautifully constructed for the purpose, are brought into fitting
  mechanical positions for completing the work of emptying the victim. Nagel states that the larva
  of <i>Dytiscus</i> injects a digestive fluid into the body of its victim, and that this fluid
  rapidly dissolves all the more solid parts of the prey, so that the rapacious larva can easily
  absorb all its victim except the insoluble outer skin. The abdomen consists of only eight
  segments, and a pair of terminal processes; the stigmata are all more or less completely
  obsolete&mdash;according to species&mdash;with the exception of the pair on the eighth segment at
  the tip of the body; the terminal segments are frequently fringed with hairs, that serve not only
  as means of locomotion, but also to float the pair of active stigmata at the surface when the
  creature rises to get air. Although the larvae of Dytiscidae are but little known, yet
  considerable diversity has already been found. Those of <i>Hyphydrus</i> and some species of
  <i>Hydroporus</i> have the front of the head produced into a horn, which is touched by the tips of
  the mandibles.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Dytiscidae are peculiar inasmuch as they appear to flourish <span class="pagenum"
  id="page213"><span class="smaller">{213}</span></span>best in the cooler waters of the earth.
  Lapland is one of the parts of Europe richest in Dytiscidae, and the profusion of species in the
  tropics compared with those of Europe is not nearly so great as it is in the case of most of the
  other families of Coleoptera. About 1800 species are at present known, and we have rather more
  than 100 species in Britain.<a id="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

  </div>

  <p>Upwards of fifty families are placed in this series; many of these families are of very small
  extent, consisting of only a few species; other families of the series are much larger, so that

  of beetles, although they are of small size, the largest attaining scarcely half an inch in
  length. They are found only in two ways; either in ants' nests, or on the wing at night. They
  apparently live exclusively in ants' nests, but migrate much. Paussidae usually live in the nests
  of terrestrial ants, but they have been found in nests of <i>Cremastogaster</i> in the spines of
  <i>Acacia fistulosa</i>. They have the power of discharging, in an explosive manner, a volatile
  caustic fluid from the anus, which is said by Loman to contain free iodine. Their relations to the
  ants are at present unexplained, though much attention has been given to the subject. When
  observed in the nests they frequently appear as if asleep, and the ants do not take much notice of
  them.</p>

  <p>On other occasions the ants endeavour to drag them into the interior of the nest, as if
  desirous of retaining their company: the <i>Paussus</i> then makes no resistance to its hosts; if,
  however, it be touched, even very slightly, by an observer, it immediately bombards: the ants, as
  may be imagined, do not approve of this, and run away. Nothing has ever been observed that would
  lead to the belief that the ants derive any benefit from the presence of the Paussi, except that
  these guests bear on some part of the body&mdash;frequently the great impressions on the
  pronotum&mdash;patches of the peculiar kind of pubescence that exists in many other kinds of
  ants'-nest beetles, and is known in some of them to secrete a substance the ants are fond of, and
  that the ants have been seen to lick the beetles. On the other hand, the Paussi have been observed
  to eat the eggs and larvae of the ants. The larva of <i>Paussus</i> is not known,<a id="NtA_95"
  href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> and Raffray doubts whether it lives in the ants' nests. There
  are about 200 species of Paussidae known, Africa, Asia and Australia being their chief countries;
  one species, <i>P. favieri</i>, is not uncommon in the Iberian peninsula and South France, and a
  single species was formerly found in Brazil. The position the family should occupy has been much
  discussed; the only forms to which they make any real approximation are Carabidae, of the group
  Ozaenides, a group of ground beetles that also crepitate. Burmeister and others have therefore
  placed the Paussidae in the series Adephaga, but we follow Raffray's view (he being the most
  recent authority on the family),<a id="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> who concludes
  that this is an anomalous group not intimately connected with any other family of Coleoptera,
  though having more affinity to Carabidae than to anything else. The recently discovered genus
  <i>Protopaussus</i> has eleven joints to the antennae, and is said to come nearer to Carabidae
  than the previously known forms did, and we may anticipate that a more extensive knowledge will
  show that the family may find a natural place in the Adephaga. The description of the abdomen
  given by Raffray is erroneous; in a specimen of the genus <i>Arthropterus</i> the writer has
  dissected, he finds that there <span class="pagenum" id="page215"><span
  class="smaller">{215}</span></span>are five ventral segments visible along the middle, six at the
  sides, as in the families of Adephaga generally. There is said to be a great difference in the
  nervous systems of Carabidae and Paussidae, but so little is known on this point that we cannot
  judge whether it is really of importance.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Gyrinidae</b> (<i>Whirligig beetles</i>).&mdash;<i>Antennae very short; four eyes;
  middle and hind legs forming short broad paddles; abdomen with six segments visible along the
  middle, seven along each side.</i> These Insects are known to all from their habit of floating
  lightly on the surface of water, and performing graceful complex curves round one another without
  colliding; sometimes they may be met with in great congregations. They are admirably constructed
  for this mode of life, which is comparatively rare in the Insect world; the Hydrometridae amongst
  the bugs, and a small number of different kinds of Diptera, being the only other Insects that are
  devoted to a life on the surface of the waters. Of all these, Gyrinidae are in their construction
  the most adapted for such a career. They are able to dive to escape danger, and they then carry
  with them a small supply of air, but do not stay long beneath the surface. Their two hind pairs of
  legs are beautifully constructed as paddles, expanding mechanically when moved in the backward
  direction, and collapsing into an extremely small space directly the resistance they meet with is
  in the other direction. The front legs of these Insects are articulated to the thorax in a
  peculiar direction so that their soles do not look <span class="pagenum" id="page216"><span
  class="smaller">{216}</span></span>downwards but towards one another; hence the sensitive adhesive
  surface used during coupling is placed on the side of the foot, forming thus a false sole: a
  remarkable modification otherwise unknown in Insects. They breathe chiefly by means of the very
  large metathoracic spiracles.</p>

  <p>The larvae (Fig. 99, A) are purely aquatic, and are highly modified for this life, being
  elongate creatures, with sharp, mandibles and nine abdominal segments, each segment bearing on
  each side a trachea branchia; these gills assist to some extent in locomotion. The stigmata are
  quite obsolete, but the terminal segment bears four processes, one pair of which may be looked on
  as cerci, the other as a pair of gills corresponding with the pair on each of the preceding
  segments. The mandibles are not suctorial, but, according to Meinert, possess an orifice for the
  discharge of the secretion of a mandibular gland. Gyrinidae are chiefly carnivorous in both the
  larval and imaginal instars. Fully 300 species are known; they are generally distributed, though
  wanting in most of the islands of the world except those of large size. The finest forms are the
  Brazilian <i>Enhydrus</i> and the <i>Porrorhynchus</i> of tropical Asia.<a id="NtA_97"
  href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> In Britain we have nine species, eight of <i>Gyrinus</i>, one of
  <i>Orectochilus</i>; the latter form is rarely seen, as it hides during the day, and performs its
  rapid gyrations at night.</p>

  <p>The Gyrinidae are one of the most distinct of all the families of Coleoptera: by some they are
  associated in the Adephagous series; but they have little or no affinity with the other members
  thereof. Without them the Adephaga form a natural series of evidently allied families, and we
  consider it a mistake to force the Gyrinidae therein because an objection is felt by many
  taxonomists to the maintenance of isolated families. Surely if there are in nature some families
  allied and others isolated, it is better for us to recognise the fact, though it makes our
  classifications look less neat and precise, and increases the difficulty of constructing
  "tables."</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 12. Hydrophilidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi five-jointed, the first joint in many cases so
  small as to be scarcely evident: antennae short, of less than eleven joints, not filiform, but
  consisting of <span class="pagenum" id="page217"><span class="smaller">{217}</span></span>three
  parts, a basal part of one or two elongate joints, an intermediate part of two or more small
  joints, and an apical part of larger (or at any rate broader) joints, which are pubescent, the
  others being bare. Outer lobe of maxillae usually complex, but not at all palpiform, maxillary
  palpi often very long; the parts of the labium much concealed behind the mentum, the labial palpi
  very widely separated. Hind coxae extending the width of the body, short, the lamina interior
  small in comparison with the lamina exterior. Abdomen of five visible segments.</i> The
  Hydrophilidae are an extensive family of beetles, unattractive in colours and appearance, and much
  neglected by collectors. A large part of the family live in water, though most of them have only
  feeble powers of aquatic locomotion, and the beetles appear chiefly to devote their attention to
  economising the stock of air each individual carries about. The best known forms of the family are
  the species of <i>Hydrophilus</i>. They are, however, very exceptional in many respects, and are
  far more active and predaceous than most of the other forms. Much has been written about
  <i>Hydrophilus piceus</i>, one of the largest of British beetles. This Insect breathes in a most
  peculiar manner: the spiracles are placed near bands of delicate pubescence, forming tracts that
  extend the whole length of the body, and in this particular species cover most of the under
  surface of the body; these velvety tracts retain a coating of air even when the Insect is
  submerged and moves quickly through the water. It would appear rather difficult to invent a
  mechanism to supply these tracts with fresh air without the Insect leaving the water; but
  nevertheless such a mechanism is provided by the antennae of the beetle, the terminal joints of
  which form a pubescent scoop, made by some longer hairs into a funnel sufficiently large to convey
  a bubble of air. The Insect therefore rises to the surface, and by means of the antennae, which it
  exposes to the air, obtains a supply with which it surrounds a large part of its body; for,
  according to Miall, it carries a supply on its back, under the elytra, as well as on its ventral
  surface. From the writer's own observations, made many years ago, he inclines to the opinion that
  the way in which the <i>Hydrophilus</i> uses the antennae to obtain air varies somewhat according
  to circumstances.</p>

  <p>Many of the members of the sub-family Hydrophilides construct egg-cocoons. In the case of
  <i>Hydrophilus piceus</i>, the <span class="pagenum" id="page218"><span
  class="smaller">{218}</span></span>boat-like structure is provided with a little mast, which is
  supposed by some to be for the purpose of securing air for the eggs. <i>Helochares</i> and
  <i>Spercheus</i> (Fig. 100) carry the cocoon of eggs attached to their own bodies.
  <i>Philydrus</i> constructs, one after the other, a number of these egg-bags, each containing
  about fifteen eggs, and fixes each bag to the leaf of some aquatic plant; the larvae as a rule
  hatch speedily, so that the advantage of the bag is somewhat problematic.</p>

  <p>The larvae of the aquatic division of the family have been to a certain extent studied by
  Schi&ouml;dte and others; those of the Sphaeridiides&mdash;the terrestrial group of the
  family&mdash;are but little known. All the larvae seem to be predaceous and carnivorous, even when
  the imago is of vegetable-feeding habits; and Dum&eacute;ril states that in <i>Hydrous caraboides</i> the
  alimentary canal undergoes a great change at the period of metamorphosis, becoming very elongate
  in the adult, though in the larva it was short. The legs are never so well developed as they are
  in the Adephaga, the tarsi being merely claw-like or altogether wanting; the mandibles are never
  suctorial. The respiratory arrangements show much diversity. In most of the Hydrophilides the
  process is carried on by a pair of terminal spiracles on the eighth abdominal segment, as in
  Dytiscidae, and these are either exposed or placed in a respiratory chamber. In <i>Berosus</i> the
  terminal stigmata are obsolete, and the sides of the body bear long branchial filaments. Cussac
  says that in <i>Spercheus</i> (Fig. 101) there are seven pairs of abdominal spiracles, and that
  the larva breathes by presenting these to the air;<a id="NtA_98" href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>
  but Schi&ouml;dte states that in this form there are neither thoracic nor abdominal spiracles, except a
  pair placed in a respiratory chamber on the eighth segment of the abdomen, after the manner
  described by Miall as existing in <i>Hydrobius</i>. No doubt Cussac was wrong in supposing the
  peculiar lateral abdominal processes to be <span class="pagenum" id="page219"><span
  class="smaller">{219}</span></span>stigmatiferous. In <i>Berosus</i> there are patches of
  a&euml;riferous, minute pubescence on the body. The pupae of Hydrophilides repose on the dorsal
  surface, which is protected by spinous processes on the pronotum, and on the sides of the
  abdomen.</p>

  <p>We have already remarked that this is one of the most neglected of the families of Coleoptera,
  and its classification is not satisfactory. It is usually divided into Hydrophilides and
  Sphaeridiides. The Sphaeridiides are in large part terrestrial, but their separation from the
  purely aquatic Hydrophilides cannot be maintained on any grounds yet pointed out. Altogether about
  1000 species of Hydrophilidae are known, but this probably is not a tenth part of those existing.
  In Britain we have nearly ninety species. Some taxonomists treat the family as a series with the
  name Palpicornia. The series Philhydrida of older authors included these Insects and the Parnidae
  and Heteroceridae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. Platypsyllidae.</b>&mdash;This consists of a single species. It will be readily
  recognised from Fig. 102, attention being given to the peculiar antennae, and to the fact that the
  mentum is trilobed behind. This curious species has been found only on the beaver. It was first
  found by Ritsema on American beavers (<i>Castor canadensis</i>) in the Zoological Gardens at
  Amsterdam, but it has since been found on wild beavers in the Rhone in France; in America it
  appears to be commonly distributed on these animals from Alaska to Texas. It is very remarkable
  that a wingless parasite of this kind should be found in both hemispheres. The Insect was
  considered by Westwood to be a separate Order called Achreioptera, but there can be no doubt that
  it is a beetle. It is also admitted that it shows some points of resemblance with Mallophaga, the
  habits of which are similar. Its Coleopterous nature is confirmed by the larva, which has been
  described by both Horn and Riley.<a id="NtA_99" href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> Little is known
  as to the food and life-history. Horn states that the eggs are placed on <span class="pagenum"
  id="page220"><span class="smaller">{220}</span></span>the skin of the beaver amongst the densest
  hair; the larvae move with a sinuous motion, like those of Staphylinidae. It has been suggested
  that the Insect feeds on an Acarid, <i>Schizocarpus mingaudi</i>; others have supposed that it
  eats scales of epithelium or hairs of the beaver.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Leptinidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Antennae rather long, eleven-jointed, without club, but a
  little thicker at the extremity. Eyes absent or imperfect. Tarsi five-jointed. Elytra quite
  covering abdomen. Mentum with the posterior angles spinously prolonged.</i> A family of only two
  genera and two species. Their natural history is obscure, but is apparently of an anomalous
  nature; the inference that may be drawn from the little that is known being that they are
  parasitic on mammals. There is little or nothing in their structure to indicate this, except the
  condition of blindness; and until recently the Insects were classified amongst Silphidae.
  <i>Leptinus testaceus</i> (Fig. 103) is a British Insect, and besides occurring in Europe is well
  known in North America. In Europe it has been found <span class="pagenum" id="page221"><span
  class="smaller">{221}</span></span>in curious places, including the nests of mice and bumble-bees.
  In America it has been found on the mice themselves by Dr. Ryder, and by Riley in the nests of a
  common field-mouse, together with its larva, which, however, has not been described. The allied
  genus <i>Leptinillus</i> is said by Riley to live on the beaver, in company with
  <i>Platypsyllus</i>.<a id="NtA_100" href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> It has been suggested that
  the natural home of the <i>Leptinus</i> is the bee's nest, and that perhaps the beetle merely
  makes use of the mouse as a means of getting from one nest of a bumble-bee to another.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 15. Silphidae.</b>&mdash;<i>The mentum is usually a transverse plate, having in front a
  membranous hypoglottis, which bears the exposed labial palpi, and immediately behind them the
  so-called bilobed ligula. The anterior coxae are conical and contiguous: prothoracic epimera and
  episterna not distinct. Visible abdominal segments usually five, but sometimes only four, or as
  many as seven. Tarsi frequently five-jointed, but often with one joint less. Elytra usually
  covering the body and free at the tips, but occasionally shorter than the body, and even truncate
  behind so as to expose from one to four of the dorsal plates; but there are at least three dorsal
  plates in a membranous condition at the base of the abdomen.</i> These beetles are extremely
  diverse in size and form, some being very minute, others upwards of an inch long, and there is
  also considerable range of structure. In this family are included the burying-beetles
  (<i>Necrophorus</i>), so well known from their habit of making excavations under the corpses of
  small Vertebrates, so as to bury them. Besides these and <i>Silpha</i>, the roving
  carrion-beetles, the family includes many other very different forms, amongst them being the
  larger part of the cave-beetles of Europe and North America. These belong mostly to the genera
  <i>Bathyscia</i> in Europe, and <i>Adelops</i> in North America; but of late years quite a crowd
  of these eyeless cave-beetles of the group Leptoderini have been discovered, so that the European
  catalogue now includes about 20 genera and 150 species. The species of the genus
  <i>Catopomorphus</i> are found in the nests of ants of the genus <i>Aphaenogaster</i> in the
  Mediterranean region. Scarcely anything is known as to the lives of either the cave-Silphidae or
  the myrmecophilous forms.</p>

  <p>The larvae of several of the larger forms of Silphidae are well known, but very little has been
  ascertained as to the smaller forms. <span class="pagenum" id="page222"><span
  class="smaller">{222}</span></span>Those of the burying-beetles have spiny plates on the back of
  the body, and do not resemble the other known forms of the family. The rule is that the three
  thoracic segments are well developed, and that ten abdominal segments are also distinct; the ninth
  abdominal segment bears a pair of cerci, which are sometimes elongate. Often the dorsal plates are
  harder and better developed than is usual in Coleopterous larvae. This is especially the case with
  some that are endowed with great powers of locomotion, such as <i>S. obscura</i> (Fig. 104). The
  food of the larvae is as a rule decomposing animal or vegetable matter, but some are predaceous,
  and attack living objects. The larger <i>Silpha</i> larvae live, like the <i>Necrophorus</i>, on
  decomposing animal matter, but run about to seek it; hence many specimens of some of these large
  larvae may sometimes be found amongst the bones of a very small dead bird. We have found the larva
  and imago of <i>S. thoracica</i> in birds' nests containing dead nestlings. <i>S. atrata</i> and
  <i>S. laevigata</i> make war on snails. <i>S. lapponica</i> enters the houses in Lapland and
  ravages the stores of animal provisions. <i>S. opaca</i> departs in a very decided manner from the
  habits of its congeners, as it attacks beetroot and other similar crops in the growing state; it
  is sometimes the cause of serious loss to the growers of beet. The larvae of the group
  Anisotomides are believed to be chiefly subterranean in habits; that of <i>A. cinnamomea</i> feeds
  on the truffle, and the beetle is known as the truffle-beetle.</p>

  <p>The number of species of Silphidae known must be at present nearer 900 than 800. Of these an
  unusually large proportion belong to the European and North American regions; Silphidae being
  apparently far from numerous in the tropics. Rather more than 100 species are natives of Britain.
  The family reappears in considerable force in New Zealand, and is probably well represented <span
  class="pagenum" id="page223"><span class="smaller">{223}</span></span>in South Australia and
  Tasmania. The most remarkable form known is perhaps the Australian genus <i>Ptomaphila</i> (Fig.
  104, B). The classification of the family is due to Dr. Horn.<a id="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> The only change of importance that has since been suggested is
  the removal of <i>Sphaerites</i> from this family to Synteliidae. Anisotomidae and Clambidae have
  been considered distinct families, but are now included in Silphidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 16. Scydmaenidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute Insects allied to Silphidae, but with the hind
  coxae separated, and the facets of the eyes coarser; the tarsi are five-jointed; the number of
  visible abdominal segments is six.</i> These small beetles are widely spread over the earth's
  surface, and about 700 species are now known, of which we have about a score in Britain; many live
  in ants' nests, but probably usually rather as intruders than as guests that have friendly
  relations with their hosts. Nothing is known as to their life-histories, but the food of the
  imago, so far as is known, consists of Acari. <i>Mastigus</i> is a very aberrant form, found in
  moss and dead leaves in Southern Europe. By means of <i>Brathinus</i> the family is brought very
  near to Silphidae; Casey, however, considers <i>Brathinus</i> to belong to Staphylinidae rather
  than to Scydmaenidae. The South European <i>Leptomastax</i> is remarkable on account of the
  slender, long, sickle-shaped mandibles. The Oriental genus <i>Clidicus</i> is the largest and most
  remarkable form of the family; it has a very slender neck to its broad head, and is more than a
  quarter of an inch long.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 17. Gnostidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute Insects with three-jointed antennae, five-jointed
  tarsi, and three apparent ventral segments, the first of which, however, is elongate, and consists
  of three united plates. Elytra entirely covering the after-body.</i> The family consists of two
  species which have been found in the nests of ants, of the genus <i>Cremastogaster</i>, in
  Brazil.<a id="NtA_102" href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 18. Pselaphidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Very small Insects; the elytra much abbreviated, usually
  leaving as much as half the abdomen uncovered; the maxillary palpi usually greatly developed, and
  of a variety of remarkable forms; the segments of the abdomen not more than seven in number, with
  little or no power of movement. Tarsi with not more than three joints.</i> These small Coleoptera
  mostly live in the nests of ants, and present a great diversity of extraordinary <span
  class="pagenum" id="page224"><span class="smaller">{224}</span></span>shapes, and very peculiar
  structures of the antennae and maxillary palpi. Owing to the consolidation of some of its
  segments, the abdomen frequently appears to have less than the usual number. In the curious
  sub-family Clavigerides, the antennae may have the joints reduced to two or even, to all
  appearance, to one; the tarsi suffer a similar reduction. There are about 2500 species of
  Pselaphidae known; many of them have never been found outside the ants' nests; very little,
  however, is known as to their natural history. It is certain that some of them excrete, from
  little tufts of peculiar pubescence, a substance that the ants are fond of. The secretory patches
  are found on very different parts of the body and appendages. <i>Claviger testaceus</i> is fed by
  the ants in the same way as these social Insects feed one another; the <i>Claviger</i> has also
  been seen to eat the larvae of the ants. They ride about on the backs of the ants when so
  inclined. The family is allied to Staphylinidae, but is easily distinguished by the rigid abdomen.
  Only one larva&mdash;that of <i>Chennium bituberculatum</i>&mdash;is known. It appears to be very
  similar to the larvae of Staphylinidae. The best account of classification and structure is that
  given by M. Achille Raffray,<a id="NtA_103" href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> who has himself
  discovered and described a large part of the known species.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 19. Staphylinidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Elytra very short, leaving always some of the abdominal
  segments exposed, and covering usually only two of the segments. Abdomen usually elongate, with
  ten dorsal, and seven or eight ventral segments; of the latter six or seven are usually exposed;
  the dorsal plates as hard as the ventral, except sometimes in the case of the first two segments;
  the segments very mobile, so that the abdomen can be curled upwards. The number of tarsal joints
  very variable, often five, but frequently as few as three, and not always the same on all the
  feet.</i> Staphylinidae (formerly called Brachelytra or Microptera) is one of the most extensive
  of even the great families of Coleoptera; notwithstanding their diversity, they may in nearly all
  cases be recognised by the more than usually mobile and uncovered abdomen, combined with the fact
  that the parts of the mouth are of the kind we have mentioned in Silphidae. The present state of
  the classification of this family has been recently discussed by Ganglbauer.<a id="NtA_104"

  <p>At present about 9000 species are known, some of which are minute, while scarcely any attain a
  size of more than an inch in length, our common British black cock-tail, or "devil's coach-horse
  beetle," <i>Ocypus olens</i>, being amongst the largest. Though the elytra are short, the wings in
  many forms are as large as those of the majority of beetles; indeed many Staphylinidae are more
  apt at taking flight than is usual with Coleoptera; the wings when not in use are packed away
  under the short elytra, being transversely folded, and otherwise crumpled, in a complicated but
  orderly manner. It is thought that the power of curling up the abdomen is connected with the
  packing away of the wings after flight; but this is not the case: for though the Insect sometimes
  experiences a difficulty in folding the wings under the elytra after they have been expanded, yet
  it overcomes this difficulty by slight movements of the base of the abdomen, rather than by
  touching the wings with the tip. What the value of this exceptional condition of short elytra and
  corneous dorsal abdominal segments to the Insect may be is at present quite mysterious. The habits
  of the members of the family are very varied; many run with great activity; the food is very often
  small Insects, living or dead; a great many are found in fungi of various kinds, and perhaps eat
  them. It is in this family that we meet with some of the most remarkable cases of symbiosis, i.e.
  lives of two kinds of creatures mutually accommodated with good will. The relations between the
  Staphylinidae of the genera <i>Atemeles</i> and <i>Lomechusa</i>, and certain ants, in the
  habitations of which they dwell, are very interesting. The beetles are never found out of the
  ants' nests, or at any rate not very far from them. The most friendly relations exist between them
  and the ants: they have patches of yellow hairs, and these <span class="pagenum"

  flavour agreeable to the ants, which lick the beetles from time to time. On the other hand, the
  ants feed the beetles; this they do by regurgitating food, at the request of the beetle, on to
  their lower lip, from which it is then taken by the beetle (Fig. 82). The beetles in many of their
  movements exactly resemble the ants, and their mode of requesting food, by stroking the ants in
  certain ways, is quite ant-like. So reciprocal is the friendship that if an ant is in want of
  food, the <i>Lomechusa</i> will in its turn disgorge for the benefit of its host. The young of the
  beetles are reared in the nests by the ants, who attend to them as carefully as they do to their
  own young. The beetles have a great fondness for the ants, and prefer to sit amongst a crowd
  thereof; they are fond of the ants' larvae as food, and indeed eat them to a very large extent,
  even when their own young are receiving food from the ants. The larva of <i>Lomechusa</i>, as
  described by Wasmann (to whom we are indebted for most of our knowledge of this subject),<a
  id="NtA_105" href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> when not fully grown, is very similar to the
  larvae of the ants; although it possesses legs it scarcely uses them: its development takes place
  with extraordinary rapidity, two days, at most, being occupied in the egg, and the larva
  completing its growth in fourteen days. Wasmann seems to be of opinion that the ants scarcely
  distinguish between the beetle-larvae and their own young; one unfortunate result for the beetle
  follows from this, viz. that in the pupal state the treatment that is suitable for the ant-larvae
  does not agree with the beetle-larvae: the ants are in the habit of digging up their own kind and
  lifting them out and cleaning them during their metamorphosis; they also do this with the
  beetle-larvae, with fatal results; so that only those that have the good fortune to be forgotten
  by the ants complete their development. Thus from thirty <i>Lomechusa</i> larvae Wasmann obtained
  a single imago, and from fifty <i>Atemeles</i> larvae not even one.</p>

  <p>Many other Staphylinidae are exclusively attached to ants' nests, but most of them are either
  robbers, at warfare with the ants&mdash;as is the case with many species of <i>Myrmedonia</i> that
  lurk about the outskirts of the nests&mdash;or are merely tolerated by the ants, not receiving any
  direct support from them. The most <span class="pagenum" id="page227"><span
  class="smaller">{227}</span></span>remarkable Staphylinidae yet discovered are some viviparous
  species, forming the genera <i>Corotoca</i> and <i>Spirachtha</i>, that have very swollen
  abdomens, and live in the nests of Termites in Brazil:<a id="NtA_106"
  href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> very little is, however, known about them. A very large and
  powerful Staphylinid, <i>Velleius dilatatus</i>, lives only in the nests of hornets and wasps. It
  has been supposed to be a defender of the Hymenoptera, but the recent observations of Janet and
  Wasmann make it clear that this is not the case: the <i>Velleius</i> has the power of making
  itself disagreeable to the hornets by some odour, and they do not seriously attack it. The
  <i>Velleius</i> finds its nutriment in larvae or pupae of the wasps that have fallen from their
  cells, or in other organic refuse.</p>

  <p>The larvae of Staphylinidae are very similar to those of Carabidae, but their legs are less
  perfect, and are terminated only by a single claw; there is no distinct labrum. The pupae of some
  are obtected, <i>i.e.</i> covered by a secondary exudation that glues all the appendages together,
  and forms a hard coat, as in Lepidoptera. We have about 800 species of Staphylinidae in Britain,
  and it is probable that the family will prove one of the most extensive of the Order. It is
  probable that one hundred thousand species or even more are at present in existence.</p>

  The extremely compact form, and hard integument, combined with the peculiar
  antennae&mdash;consisting of a long basal joint, six or seven small joints, and then a very solid
  club of three joints covered with minute pubescence&mdash;render these Insects unmistakable. The
  colour is usually shining black, but there are numerous departures from this. The way in which
  these Insects are put together so as to leave no chink in their hard exterior armour when in

  ninth segment of the abdomen terminal, with two distinctly jointed cerci.<a id="NtA_114"
  href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> Histeridae are common in dung, in carcases, decaying fungi,
  etc., and some live under bark&mdash;these being, in the case of the genus <i>Hololepta</i>, very
  flat. Some are small cylinders, elaborately constructed, for entering the burrows of Insects in
  wood (<i>Trypanaeus</i>); a certain number are peculiar to ants' nests. Formerly it was supposed
  that the Insects were nourished on the decaying substances, but it is now believed, with good
  reason, that they are eminently predaceous, in both larval and imaginal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page231"><span class="smaller">{231}</span></span>instars, and devour the larvae of Diptera,
  etc. The relations of the ants'-nest forms to the ants is not made out, but it is highly probable

  in company with Termites.</p>

  joints of antennae rather broader, usually long; front coxae globular; posterior coxae contiguous;
  abdomen with five visible ventral segments; tarsi five-jointed, fourth joint usually small and
  obscure.</i> This family consists entirely of small Insects: the tarsal structure is very
  aberrant, and is also diverse, so that the student may without careful observation pass the
  Insects over as having only four-jointed tarsi; their structure, so far as the front two pairs are
  concerned, being very nearly that of many Phytophaga. The larvae live in the heads of flowers,
  especially of the flowers of Compositae. Having bored their way down the stems, they pupate in
  earthen cocoons. Heeger<a id="NtA_115" href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> says that he has
  observed in favourable seasons six generations; but the larvae die readily in unfavourable
  seasons, and are destroyed in vast numbers when the meadows are mowed. Seven years ago very little
  was known as to the family, and the list of their species scarcely amounted to 100, but now
  probably 300 are described. They occur in all parts of the world; we have fourteen in Britain.</p>

  1600 species being at present known; in many of them the elytra nearly or quite cover the hind
  body, but in many others they are more or less abbreviated; in this case the Insects may be
  distinguished from Staphylinidae by the form of their antennae, and the smaller number of visible
  ventral segments. The habits are very varied, a great many are found on flowers, others are
  attracted by the sap of trees; some live in carcases. We have about 90 species in Britain; several
  forms of <span class="pagenum" id="page232"><span class="smaller">{232}</span></span>the genera
  <i>Meligethes</i> and <i>Epuraea</i> are among the most abundant of our beetles. Most of what is
  known as to the larvae is due to Perris; several have been found living in flowers; that of
  <i>Pria</i> haunts the flower of <i>Solanum dulcamara</i> at the junction of the stamens with the
  corolla; the larva of <i>Meligethes aeneus</i> sometimes occasions much loss by preventing the
  formation of seed in cultivated Cruciferae, such as Rape. These floricolous larvae grow with great
  rapidity, and then leave the flowers to pupate in the ground. The larva of <i>Nitidula</i> lives
  in carcases, though it is not very different from that of <i>Pria</i>. The larva of <i>Soronia</i>
  lives in fermenting sap, and has four hooks curving upwards at the extremity of the body. The
  curious genus <i>Cybocephalus</i> consists of some very small, extremely convex Insects that live
  in flowers in Southern Europe; they have only four joints to the tarsi. The perfect Insects of the
  group Ipides are remarkable from having a stridulating organ on the front of the head. The
  classification of the well-known genus <i>Rhizophagus</i> has given rise to much discussion;
  although now usually placed in Nitidulidae, we think it undoubtedly belongs to Cucujidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 29. Trogositidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Differs from Nitidulidae in the structure of the tarsi;
  these appear to be four-jointed, with the third joint similar in size and form to the preceding;
  they are, however, really five-jointed, an extremely short basal joint being present. Hind coxae
  contiguous. The club of each antenna is bilaterally asymmetric, and the sensitive surface is
  confined to certain parts of the joints.</i> There are some 400 or 500 species of Trogositidae,
  but nearly all of them are exotic. The larvae (Fig. 113, A), are predaceous, destroying other
  larvae in large numbers, and it is probable that the imagos do the same. The larva of
  <i>Tenebroides</i> (better known as <i>Trogosita</i>) <i>mauritanica</i> is found in corn and
  flour, and is said to have sometimes been very <span class="pagenum" id="page233"><span
  class="smaller">{233}</span></span>injurious by eating the embryo of the corn, but it is
  ascertained that it also devours certain other larvae that live on the corn. This beetle has been
  carried about by commerce, and is now nearly cosmopolitan. Our three British species of
  Trogositidae represent the three chief divisions of the family, viz. Nemosomides, Temnochilides,
  Peltides; they are very dissimilar in form, the Peltides being oval, with retracted head. It is
  doubtful whether the members of the latter group are carnivorous in any of their stages; it is
  more probable that they live on the fungi they frequent. Peltidae stand as a distinct family in
  many works.<a id="NtA_116" href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

  the joints broad; front and middle coxae small, globose, embedded; hind coxae transverse, either
  contiguous or separated; five visible ventral segments, several of which have no movement.</i>
  This is a family of interest, owing to the great diversity of form, to the extraordinary sculpture
  and clothing exhibited by many of its members, and to the fact that most of its members are
  attached to the primitive forests, and disappear entirely when these are destroyed. We have
  fifteen species in Britain, but about half of them are of the greatest rarity. There are about 600
  species known at present; New Zealand has produced the greatest variety of forms; the forests of
  Teneriffe are rich in the genus <i>Tarphius</i>. The sedentary lives of many of these beetles are
  very remarkable; the creatures concealing themselves in the crannies of fungus-covered wood, and
  scarcely ever leaving their retreats, so that it is the rarest circumstance to find them at any
  distance from their homes. <i>Langelandia anophthalma</i> lives entirely underground and is quite
  blind, the optic lobes being absent. Some Colydiidae are more active, and enter the burrows of
  wood-boring Insects to destroy the larvae (<i>Colydium</i>). Few of the larvae are known; but all
  appear to have the body terminated by peculiar hard corneous processes, as is the case with a
  great variety of Coleopterous larvae that live in wood.<a id="NtA_117"

  but is found nearly all over the world in the warm and temperate regions. In many of their
  characters they resemble the Adephaga, but are very different in appearance and in the mouth. The
  larvae are not known. Some authorities think these Insects should be placed in the series
  Adephaga,<a id="NtA_118" href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> but it is more probable that they
  will prove to be amongst the numerous aberrant forms of Coleoptera that approach the various large
  natural series, without really belonging to them. The three families, Colydiidae, Cucujidae, and
  Rhysodidae, exhibit relations not only with other families of the Coleoptera Polymorpha, but also
  with most of the great series; Adephaga, Rhynchophora, Phytophaga, and Heteromera, being each

  families to define; indeed it is in this portion of the Clavicorns that an extended and thorough
  study is most urgently required. The Cucujidae include a great diversity of forms; they are mostly
  found under the bark of trees, and many of them are very flat. Many of the larvae are also very
  flat, but Ferris says there is great diversity in their structure: they are probably chiefly
  carnivorous. There are about 400 species described; we have nearly a score in Britain.</p>

  apparently have mould-eating habits, though very little is known on this point and several of the
  genera (<i>Antherophagus</i>, <i>Telmatophilus</i>) are found chiefly on growing plants,
  especially in flowers. Although the imago of <i>Antherophagus</i> lives in flowers, yet the larva
  has only been found in the nests of bumble-bees; there is reason for believing that the imago
  makes use of the bee to transport it from the flowers it haunts to the nests in which it is to
  breed;<a id="NtA_119" href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> this it does by catching hold of the bee
  with its mandibles when the bee visits the flower in which the beetle is concealed. It is strange
  the beetle should adopt such a mode of getting to its future home, for it has ample wings. We must
  presume that its senses and instinct permit it to recognise the bee, but do not suffice to enable
  it to find the bee's nest. Some of the larvae of the genus <i>Cryptophagus</i> are found
  abundantly in the nests of various wasps, where they are probably useful as scavengers, others
  occur in the nests of social caterpillars, and they are sometimes common in loose straw; this
  being the habitat in which Perris found the one we figure.</p>

  angular prolongation externally; all the coxae widely separated; five visible ventral segments,
  all mobile.</i> The Insects of this family are closely allied to Trogositidae and Nitidulidae, and
  have the tarsal structure of the former family; but the Helotidae are different in appearance from
  any members of either of these two families, and are readily distinguished by the coxal character.
  They are frequently classified with the Erotylidae, from which they differ by the differently
  shaped feet, especially by the diminished basal joint. <span class="pagenum" id="page236"><span
  class="smaller">{236}</span></span>There is but one genus, and for a long time only two or three
  species were known, and were great rarities in collections; in the last few years the number has
  been raised to nearly forty.<a id="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> They are
  remarkable beetles with oblong form, and a somewhat metallic upper surface, which is much
  sculptured, and possesses four yellow, smooth spots on the elytra. According to Mr. George Lewis
  they are found feeding at the running sap of trees, but the larvae are not known. Helotidae are
  peculiar to the Indo-Malayan region (including Japan) with one species in Eastern Africa.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 35. Thorictidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi five-jointed, none of the joints broad; front coxae
  small, rather prominent, but not at all transverse; five visible ventral plates, all mobile;
  metasternum very short; antennae short, with a solid club.</i> This little family, consisting of
  the genus <i>Thorictus</i>, appears to be a distinct one, though the structure has only been very
  imperfectly studied. It is peculiar to the Mediterranean region, where the species live in ants'
  nests. They appear to be on terms of great intimacy with the ants; a favourite position of the
  beetle is on the scape of the antenna of an ant; here it hooks itself on firmly, and is carried
  about by the ant. Like so many other ants'-nest beetles, Thorictidae possess tufts of golden hair,
  which secrete some substance, the flavour of which is appreciated by the ants; these tufts in
  Thorictidae are situated either at the hind angles of the pronotum, or on the under surface of the
  body on each side of the breast; Wasmann thinks that when the beetles are riding about, as above
  described, the ants have then an opportunity of getting at the patches on the under surface.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 36. Erotylidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi five-jointed, but with the fourth usually very
  small, the first three more or less broad and pubescent beneath. Antennae strongly clubbed. Front
  and middle coxal acetabula round, without angular prolongation externally; five visible ventral
  segments.</i> This is now a large and important family of about 1800 species, but it is chiefly
  exotic and tropical, its members haunting the fungoid growths <span class="pagenum"
  id="page237"><span class="smaller">{237}</span></span>in forests. We have only six species in
  Britain, and the whole of Europe has only about two dozen, most of them insignificant (and in the
  case of the Dacnides aberrant, approaching the Cryptophagidae very closely). The sub-family
  Languriides (quite wanting in Europe) consists of more elongate Insects, with front acetabula open
  behind; they have different habits from Erotylides proper; some are known to live as larvae in the
  stems of herbaceous plants. They possess a highly developed stridulating organ on the front of the
  head. The Clavicorn Polymorpha are very closely connected with the Phytophaga by Languriides.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 37. Mycetophagidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi four-jointed, slender, the front feet of the
  male only three-jointed; coxae oval, not deeply embedded; abdomen with five ventral segments, all
  movable.</i> A small family, of interest chiefly because of the anomaly in the feet of the two
  sexes, for which it is impossible to assign any reason. The species are small, uninteresting
  Insects that live chiefly on Cryptogams of various kinds, especially in connection with timber;
  the larvae being also found there. There are about a dozen species in Britain, and scarcely 100
  are described from all the world. The Diphyllides, placed by Leconte and Horn in this family, seem
  to go better in Cryptophagidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 38. Coccinellidae</b> (<i>Lady-birds</i>).&mdash;<i>Tarsi apparently three-jointed; the
  first two joints pubescent beneath; the third joint consisting really of two joints, the small
  true third joint being inserted near the base of the second joint, the upper surface of which is
  grooved to receive it. Head much concealed by the thorax. Antennae feebly clubbed.</i> The
  lady-birds number fully 2000 species. The structure of their feet distinguishes them from nearly
  all other Coleoptera except Endomychidae, which are much less rotund in form, and have larger
  antennae. One genus of Endomychids&mdash;<i>Panomoea</i>&mdash;bears, however, a singular
  resemblance to lady-birds, both in form and style of coloration. Several species of Coccinellidae
  are remarkable on account of the numerous variations in colour they present. Coccinellidae
  frequently multiply to an enormous extent, and are of great value, as they destroy wholesale the
  plant-lice, scale-Insects, <span class="pagenum" id="page238"><span
  class="smaller">{238}</span></span>and Acari that are so injurious to cultivated plants. They also
  eat various other soft-bodied Insects that attack plants. As they are excessively voracious, and
  are themselves singularly free from enemies and multiply with great rapidity, all these features
  of their economy render them of inestimable value to the agriculturist and horticulturist. The
  species of the sub-family Epilachnides feed on plants, and one or two are occasionally injurious.
  The body-fluid of Coccinellidae has an unpleasant odour and taste. Many lady-birds have the power
  of exuding, when disturbed, small quantities of a yellow fluid. Lutz has shown that this is not a
  special secretion, but an exudation of the fluid of the body that takes place through a small
  orifice at the tip of the tibia, from pressure caused by contraction of the body and limb.<a
  id="NtA_121" href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The larvae are much more active than beetle-larvae usually are, and many of them are very
  conspicuous when running about on plants to hunt their prey. They usually cast their skins three
  times, and sometimes concomitantly change a good deal in colour and form; the larval life does not
  usually exceed four or five weeks; at the end of which time the larva suspends itself by the
  posterior extremity, which is glued by a secretion to some object; the larval skin is pushed back
  to the anal extremity, disclosing the pupa; this differs in several respects from the usual pupa
  of beetles; it is harder, and is coloured, frequently conspicuously spotted, and dehisces to allow
  the escape of the beetle, so that the metamorphosis is altogether more like that of Lepidoptera
  than that of Coleoptera. There is much variety in the larvae; some of them bear large,
  complexly-spined, projections; those of the group Scymnites have small depressions on the surface,
  from which it has been ascertained that waxy secretions exude; but in <i>Scymnus minimus</i> no
  such excretions are formed. Certain species, when pupating, do not shuffle the skin to the
  extremity of the body, but retain it as a covering for the pupa. The larvae that feed on plants
  are much less active than the predaceous forms. We are well supplied with Coccinellidae in
  Britain, forty species being known here.</p>

  <p>The systematic position of Coccinellidae amongst the Coleoptera has been for long a moot point.
  Formerly they were associated with various other beetles having three-jointed, or apparently
  three-jointed, feet, as a series with the name Trimera, or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page239"><span class="smaller">{239}</span></span>Pseudotrimera. But they are generally placed
  in the Clavicorn series, near Endomychidae. Verhoeff has recently made considerable morphological
  studies on the male genital organs of Coleoptera, and as the result, he concludes that
  Coccinellidae differ radically from all other Coleoptera as regards these structures, and he
  therefore treats them as a distinct series or sub-order, termed Siphonophora. The genus
  <i>Lithophilus</i> has been considered doubtfully a member of Coccinellidae, as the tarsi possess
  only in a slight degree the shape characteristic of the family: Verhoeff finds that they are truly
  Coccinellidae, forming a distinct division, Lithophilini; and our little species of
  <i>Coccidula</i>, which have somewhat the same appearance as Lithophilini, he treats as another
  separate group, Coccidulini.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 39. Endomychidae.</b><a id="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Tarsi
  apparently three-jointed, the first two joints broad, the terminal joint elongate; at the base of
  the terminal joint there is, however, a very small joint, so that the tarsi are pseudotetramerous;
  antennae rather large, with a large club; labium not at all retracted behind the mentum; front and
  middle coxae globose; abdomen with five movable ventral segments, and a sixth more or less visible
  at the tip.</i> This family includes a considerable diversity of elegant Insects that frequent
  fungoid growths on wood. It comprises at present fully 500 species, but nearly the whole of them
  are exotic, and inhabit the tropical forests. We have only two British species, both of which are
  now rarities, but apparently were much commoner at the beginning of the century. The larvae are
  broader than is usual in Coleoptera; very few, however, are known.</p>

  movable; front and middle coxae globular.</i> The little Insects composing this family are by many
  placed as a division of Endomychidae, and Verhoeff is of opinion that the group is an altogether
  artificial one; but we think, with Duval, it makes matters simpler to separate them. There are
  only <span class="pagenum" id="page240"><span class="smaller">{240}</span></span>some forty or
  fifty species, found chiefly in Europe and North America. We have three in Britain; one of these,
  <i>Mycetaca hirta</i> is very common, and may be found in abundance in cellars in the heart of
  London, as well as elsewhere; it is said to have injured the corks of wine-bottles, and to have
  caused leakage of the wine, but we think that it perhaps only increases some previous deficiency
  in the corkage, for its natural food is fungoid matters. The larva is remarkable on account of the
  clubbed hairs at the sides of the body.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 41. Latridiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi three-jointed; anterior coxal cavities round, not
  prolonged externally; abdomen with five visible and mobile ventral segments.</i> Very small
  Insects, species of which are numerous in most parts of the world, the individuals being sometimes
  very abundant. The larvae (Fig. 120, A) are said by Perris to have the mandibles replaced by
  fleshy appendages. The pupa of <i>Latridius</i> is remarkable, on account of the numerous long
  hairs with heads instead of points; the larva of <i>Corticaria</i> is very like that of
  <i>Latridius</i>, but some of the hairs are replaced by obconical projections. The sub-family
  Monotomides is by many treated as a distinct family; they have the elytra truncate behind,
  exposing the pygidium, and the coxae are very small and very deeply embedded. Most of the
  Latridiidae are believed to live on fungoid matters; species of <i>Monotoma</i> live in ants'
  nests, but probably have no relations with the ants. A few species of Latridiides proper also
  maintain a similar life; <i>Coluocera formicaria</i> is said to be fond of the stores laid up by
  <i>Aphaenogaster structor</i> in its nests. About 700 species are now known; scarcely any of the
  individuals are more than one-tenth of an inch long. We have about 40 species in Britain. The
  North American genus <i>Stephostethus</i> has the prosternum constructed behind the coxae,
  somewhat in the same manner as it is in the Rhynchophorous series of Coleoptera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 43. Dermestidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi five-jointed; antennae usually short, with the club
  frequently very large in proportion, and with the under side of the thorax bearing a hollow for
  its reception. Front coxae rather long, oblique: hind coxa formed to receive the femur when in
  repose.</i> A family of 300 or 400 species of small or moderate-sized beetles; the surface,
  usually covered with fine hair, forming a pattern, or with scales. <i>Byturus</i>, the position of
  which has long been disputed, has now been placed in this family; it has a more imperfectly formed
  prosternum, and the third and fourth joints of the tarsi are prolonged as membranous lobes
  beneath; the hind coxae leave the femora quite free. Dermestidae in the larval state nearly all
  live on dried animal matter, and are sometimes very destructive; some of them totally destroy
  zoological collections. They are very remarkable on account of the complex clothing of hairs they
  bear; they have good powers of locomotion, and many of them have a peculiar gait, running for a
  short distance, then stopping and vibrating some of their hairs with extreme rapidity. They
  exhibit great variety of form. Many of them are capable of supporting life for long periods on
  little or no food, and in such cases moult an increased number of times: pupation takes place in
  the larval skin. <i>Anthrenus fasciatus</i> has been reared in large numbers on a diet of dried
  horse-hair in furniture. The young larva of this species observed by the writer did not possess
  the remarkable, complex arrangement of hairs that appeared when it was further grown. The most
  curious of Dermestid larvae is that of <i>Tiresias serra</i>, which lives amongst cobwebs in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page242"><span class="smaller">{242}</span></span>old wood, and probably feeds
  on the remains of Insects therein, perhaps not disdaining the cobwebs themselves. Attention has
  been frequently called to the hairs of the larvae of these Insects, but they have never been
  adequately discussed, and their function is quite unknown.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 44. Byrrhidae</b> (<i>Pill-beetles</i>).&mdash;<i>Oval or round, convex beetles; tarsi
  five-jointed, front coxae not exserted, transverse; hind coxa shielding the retracted femur. The
  whole of the appendages capable of a complete apposition to the body.</i> Although a small family
  of only 200 or 300 species, Byrrhidae are so heterogeneous that no characteristic definition that
  will apply to all the sub-families can be framed. Very little is known as to their life-histories.
  <i>Byrrhus pilula</i> is one of our commonest beetles, and may be found crawling on paths in early
  spring even in towns; it moves very slowly, and when disturbed, at once contracts the limbs so
  completely that it looks like an inanimate object. The larva is cylindrical, soft; the prothoracic
  and last two abdominal segments are larger than the others, the last bearing two pseudopods; its
  habits are unknown, and no good figure exists of it.</p>

  <p>The chief groups of Byrrhidae are Nosodendrides, Byrrhides (including Amphicyrtides),
  Limnichides, and Chelonariides. The first consists of species frequenting the exuding sap of
  trees; they have an unusually large mentum, abruptly clubbed antennae, and the head cannot be
  retracted and concealed. The genus <i>Nosodendron</i> seems to be distributed over a large part of
  the world. The Byrrhides have the antennae gradually thicker towards the tip, the mentum small,
  and the head and thorax so formed that the former can be perfectly retracted. The species are
  rather numerous, and are found in the northern and antipodeal regions, being nearly completely
  absent from the tropics. The Limnichides are minute Insects living in very moist places; they have
  small delicate antennae, which are imperfectly clubbed. The group is very widely distributed.</p>

  <p>The Chelonariides are a very peculiar form of Coleoptera: oval Insects of small size with the
  prothorax so formed that the head can be withdrawn under (rather than into) it, and then abruptly
  inflexed, so that the face then forms part of the under surface: the antennae have the basal three
  joints thicker than the others; these being not in the least clubbed, but having the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page243"><span class="smaller">{243}</span></span>joints so delicately
  connected that the organs are rarely unmutilated. The modifications of the head and prothorax are
  quite unlike those of other Byrrhidae, and if the Chelonariides do not form a distinct family,
  they should be associated with Dascillidae. Nothing is known as to the earlier stages. They are
  chiefly tropical Insects, though one species is found in North America.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 45. Cyathoceridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute Insects of broad form; parts of the mouth
  concealed; antennae four-jointed; tarsi not divided into joints; prosternum small.</i> The only
  species of this aberrant family, <i>Cyathocerus horni</i>, has been found in Central America.
  Nothing is known as to its life-history.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 46. Georyssidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Antennae short, clubbed; tarsi four-jointed; prosternum
  very small; front coxae exserted, but not contiguous.</i> There are about two dozen species of
  these small beetles known. Our British <i>Georyssus pygmaeus</i> lives in extremely wet places,
  and covers itself with a coating of mud or fine sand so that it can only be detected when in
  movement. Nothing further is known as to its life-history or habits. Members of the genus have
  been detected in widely-separated parts of the globe.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 47. Heteroceridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Labrum and mandibles projecting forwards; antennae
  short, the terminal seven joints broad and short, forming a sort of broad serrate club; legs armed
  with stout spines; tarsi four-jointed.</i> The Heteroceridae are small beetles covered with very
  dense but minute pubescence; they live in burrows among mud or sand in wet places, and are found
  in many parts of the world. They possess a stridulating organ in the form of a slightly elevated
  curved line on each side of the base of the abdomen, rubbed by the posterior femur. The larvae
  live in the same places as the beetles; they have well-developed thoracic legs, the mandibles are
  porrect, the three thoracic segments rather large, and the body behind these becomes gradually
  narrower; they are believed to eat the mud amongst which they burrow. We have seven British
  species of Heteroceridae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 48. Parnidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Prosternum distinct in front of the coxae, usually elongate,
  behind forming a process received into a definite cavity on the mesosternum; head retractile, the
  mouth protected by the prosternum. Tarsi five-jointed, terminal joint long.</i> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page244"><span class="smaller">{244}</span></span>Although the characters of
  these Insects are not very different from those of Byrrhidae, of Dascillidae, and even of certain
  Elateridae, there is practically but little difficulty in distinguishing Parnidae. They are of
  aquatic habits, though many, in the perfect state, frequently desert the waters. There are about
  300 or 400 species known, but the family is doubtless more extensive, as these small beetles
  attract but little notice. There are two groups:&mdash;1. Parnides, in which the front coxae have
  a considerable transverse extension, the antennae are frequently short and of peculiar structure,
  and the body is usually clothed with a peculiar, dense pubescence. 2. Elmides, with round front
  coxae, a bare, or feebly pubescent body, and simple antennae. <i>Parnus</i> is a genus commonly
  met with in Europe, and is less aquatic in habits than its congeners; it is said to enter the
  water carrying with it a coating of air attached to its pubescence. Its larvae are not well known;
  they live in damp earth near streams, and are said to much resemble the larvae of Elateridae.
  <i>Potamophilus acuminatus</i> has a very interesting larva, described by Dufour; it lives on
  decaying wood in the Adour. It is remarkable from the ocelli being arranged so as to form an
  almost true eye on each side of the head; there are eight pairs of abdominal spiracles, and also a
  pair on the mesothorax, though there are none on the pro- or meta-thorax; each of the stigmata has
  four elongate sacs between it and the main tracheal tube; the body is terminated by a process from
  which there can be protruded bunches of filamentous branchiae. The larvae of <i>Macronychus
  quadrituberculatus</i> is somewhat similar, though the features of its external structure are less
  remarkable. The Elmides live attached to stones in streams; the larva is rather broad, fringed at
  the sides of the body, and bears behind three elegant sets of fine filamentous branchiae. The
  North American genus <i>Psephenus</i> is placed in Parnidae, though instead of five, the male has
  seven, the female six, visible ventral segments; the larva is elliptical, with dilated margins to
  the body. Friederich, has given,<a id="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> without
  mentioning any names, a detailed account of Brazilian Parnid larvae, that may perhaps be allied to
  <i>Psephenus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 49. Derodontidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi five-jointed, slender, fourth joint rather small;
  front coxae prominent and transversely <span class="pagenum" id="page245"><span
  class="smaller">{245}</span></span>prolonged; middle coxae small; abdomen with five visible
  segments, all mobile, the first not elongated.</i> One of the smallest and least known of the
  families of Coleoptera; it consists of four or five species of small Insects of the genera
  <i>Derodontus</i> and <i>Peltasticta</i>, found in North America, Europe, and Japan. The
  distinction of the family from Cleridae is by no means certain; our European <i>Laricobius</i>
  apparently possessing characters but little different. Nothing is known as to the
  life-histories.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 50. Cioidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Small or minute beetles; antennae short, terminal joints
  thicker; tarsi short, four-jointed; anterior and middle coxae small, oval, deeply embedded;
  abdomen with five ventral segments, all mobile.</i> The position of these obscure little Insects
  seems to be near Colydiidae and Cryptophagidae, though they are usually placed near Bostrichidae.
  So far as known, they all live in fungi, or in wood penetrated by fungoid growths. The cylindrical
  larvae live also in similar matter; they usually have the body terminated behind by one or two
  hooks curved upwards; that of <i>Cis melliei</i> (Fig. 124) has, instead of these hooks, a curious
  chitinous tube. About 300 species of the family are now known; a score, or so, occurring in
  Britain. The Hawaiian Islands have a remarkably rich and varied fauna of Cioidae.</p>

  feet, opinions differing as to whether the number of joints of the hind tarsi is four or five.
  These Insects live in fungi growing in wood, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Reticularia hortensis</i>, that are at
  first pulpy and <span class="pagenum" id="page246"><span
  class="smaller">{246}</span></span>afterwards become powder. The larvae of both of our British
  genera, <i>Sphindus</i> and <i>Aspidiphorus</i>, have been described by Perris, who considers them
  allied to the fungivorous Silphidae and Latridiidae. The systematic position of these Insects has

  contiguous, very little extended transversely; five visible ventral segments.</i> The Bostrichidae
  attack dry wood, and sometimes in such large numbers that timber is entirely destroyed by them;
  most of them make cylindrical burrows into the wood. The larvae have the posterior part of the
  body incurved, and resemble the wood-boring larvae of Anobiidae rather than the predaceous larvae
  of Cleridae. We follow Leconte and Horn in placing Lyctides as a division of Bostrichidae;
  although differing very much in appearance, they have similar habits and larvae. The typical
  Bostrichides are remarkable for their variety of sculpture and for the shapes of the posterior
  part of the body; this part is more or less conspicuously truncate, and furnished with small
  prominences. <i>Dinapate wrightii</i>, found in the stems of a species of <i>Yucca</i> in the
  Mojave desert of California, attains a length of nearly two inches; its larva is extremely similar
  to that of <i>A. capucina</i>. Some of the forms (<i>Phonapate</i>) stridulate in a manner
  peculiar to themselves, by rubbing the front leg against some projections at the hind angle of the
  prothorax. Upwards of 200 species of the family are known. In Britain we have only four small and
  aberrant forms.</p>

  <p>Ptinidae are sometimes very destructive to dried animal matter, and attack specimens in
  museums; Anobiides bore into wood, and apparently emerge as perfect Insects only for a very brief
  period; <i>Anobium</i> (<i>Sitodrepa</i>) <i>paniceum</i> is, however, by no means restricted in
  its tastes; it must possess extraordinary powers of digestion, as we have known it to pass several
  consecutive generations on a diet of opium; it has also been reported to thrive on tablets of
  dried compressed meat; in India it is said to disintegrate books; a more usual food of the Insect
  is, however, hard biscuits; weevilly biscuits are known to every sailor, and the so-called
  "weevil" is usually the larva of <i>A. paniceum</i> (Fig. 127, B). In the case of this Insect we
  have not detected more than one spiracle (situate on the first thoracic segment); the other known
  larvae of Anobiides are said to possess eight abdominal spiracles. The skeleton in some of this
  sub-family is extremely modified, so as to allow the Insects to pack themselves up in repose; the
  head is folded in over the chest, and a cavity existing on the breast is thus closed by the head;
  in this cavity the antennae and the prominent mouth-parts are received and protected; the legs
  shut together <span class="pagenum" id="page248"><span class="smaller">{248}</span></span>in an
  equally perfect manner, so that no roughness or chink remains, and the creature looks like a
  little hard seed. <i>Anobium striatum</i> is a common Insect in houses, and makes little round
  holes in furniture, which is then said to be "worm-eaten." <i>A.</i> (<i>Xestobium</i>)
  <i>tessellatum</i>, a much larger Insect, has proved very destructive to beams in churches,
  libraries, etc. These species are the "death-watches" or "greater death-watches" that have been
  associated with the most ridiculous superstitions (as we have mentioned in Volume V., when
  speaking of the lesser death-watches, or Psocidae). The ticking of these Insects is really
  connected with sex, and is made by striking the head rapidly against the wood on which the Insect
  is standing.</p>

  <p>The very anomalous genus <i>Ectrephes</i> (Fig. 128) is found in ants' nests in Australia.
  Westwood placed it in Ptinidae. Wasmann has recently treated it as a distinct family, Ectrephidae,

  Scydmaenidae.</p>

  forms: viz. Lycides, Drilides, Lampyrides, Telephorides; though they are very different in
  appearance, classifiers have not yet agreed on separating them as families. Of these the
  Lampyrides, or glow-worms, are of special interest, as most of their members give off a
  phosphorescent light when alive; in many of them the female is apterous and like a larva, and then
  the light it gives is usually conspicuous, frequently much more so than that of its mate; in other
  cases the males are the most brilliant. The exact importance of these characters in the creatures'
  lives is not yet clear, but it appears probable that in the first class of cases the light of the
  female serves as an attraction to the male, while in the second class the very brilliant lights of
  the male serve as an amusement, or as an incitement to rivalry amongst the individuals of this
  sex.</p>

  <p>The well-known fire-flies (<i>Luciola</i>) of Southern Europe are an example of the latter
  condition. They are gregarious, and on calm, warm nights crowds of them may be seen moving and
  sparkling in a charming manner. These individuals are all, or nearly all, males; so rare indeed is
  the female that few entomologists have even noticed it. The writer once assisted in a large
  gathering of <i>Luciola italica</i> in the Val Anzasca, which consisted of many hundreds of
  specimens; all of those he caught, either on the wing or displaying their lights on the bushes,
  were males, but he found a solitary female on the ground. This sex possesses ordinary, small eyes
  instead of the large, convex organs of the male, and its antennae and legs are much more feeble,
  so that though provided with elytra and wings it is altogether a more imperfect creature. Emery
  has given an account of his observations and experiments on this Insect, but they do not give any
  clear idea as to the exact function of the light.<a id="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> In our British glow-worm the female is entirely
  apterous&mdash;hence the name glow-worm&mdash;but the male has elytra and ample wings, and
  frequently flies at night into lighted apartments. Although so little has been ascertained as to
  the light of Lampyridae, there are two facts that justify us in supposing that it is in some way
  of importance to the species. These are: (1) that in a great many species the eyes have a
  magnificent and unusual development; (2) that the habits of the creatures are in nearly all cases
  nocturnal. It is true that the little <i>Phosphaenus hemipterus</i> is said to be diurnal in
  habits, but it is altogether an exceptional form, being destitute of wings in both sexes, and
  possessed of only very feeble light-giving powers, and we have, moreover, very little real
  knowledge as to its natural history; it is said <span class="pagenum" id="page250"><span
  class="smaller">{250}</span></span>that the female is of the utmost rarity, though the male is not
  uncommon.</p>

  <p>The nature of the luminosity of <i>Lampyris</i> has given rise to many contradictory
  statements; the light looks somewhat like that given off by phosphorus, and is frequently spoken
  of as phosphorescence; but luminescence is a better term. The egg, larva, pupa, and male are
  luminous as well as the female (at any rate in <i>L. noctiluca</i>); the luminescence is, however,
  most marked in the female imago, in which it is concentrated near the extremity of the abdomen;
  here there are two strata of cells, and many fine capillary tracheae are scattered through the
  luminous substance. Wielowiejski concludes that the light-producing power is inherent in the cells
  of the luminous organ, and is produced by the slow oxidation of a substance formed under the
  influence of the nervous system. The cells are considered to be essentially similar to those of
  the fat-body.<a id="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> The luminescence of Lampyridae is
  very intermittent, that is to say, it is subject to rapid diminutions and increases of its
  brilliancy; various reasons have been assigned for this, but all are guesses, and all that can be
  said is that the changes are possibly due to diminution or increase of the air-supply in the
  luminous organ, but of the way in which this is controlled there seems to be no evidence.
  Considerable difference of opinion has existed as to the luminescence of the eggs of
  <i>Lampyris</i>. If it exist in the matter contained in the egg, it is evident that it is
  independent of the existence of tracheae or of a nervous system. Newport and others believed that
  the light given by the egg depended merely on matter on its exterior. The observations of Dubois<a
  id="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> show, however, that it exists in the matter in
  the egg; he has even found it in the interior of eggs that had been deposited unfertilised.</p>

  <p>From time to time, since the commencement of the nineteenth century, there have appeared
  imperfect accounts of extraordinary light-giving larvae found in South America, of various sizes,
  but attaining in some cases a length, it is said, of three inches; they are reported as giving a
  strong red light from the two extremities of the body, and a green light from numerous points
  along the <span class="pagenum" id="page251"><span class="smaller">{251}</span></span>sides of the
  body, and hence are called, it is said, in Paraguay the railway-beetle. We may refer the reader to
  Haase's paper<a id="NtA_128" href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> on the subject of these "larvae,"
  as we can here only say that it appears probable that most of these creatures may prove to be
  adult females of the extraordinary group Phengodini, in which it would appear that the imago of
  the female sex is in a more larva-like state than it is in any other Insects. The males, however,
  are well-developed beetles; unlike the males of Lampyrides, in general they have not peculiar
  eyes, but on the other hand they possess antennae which are amongst the most highly developed
  known, the joints being furnished on each side with a long appendage densely covered with
  pubescence of a remarkable character. There is no reason to doubt that Haase was correct in
  treating the Insect we figure (Fig. 129, B) as a perfect Insect; he is, indeed, corroborated by
  Riley.<a id="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> The distinctions between the larva and
  female imago are that the latter has two claws on the feet instead of one, a greater number of
  joints in the antennae, and less imperfect eyes; the female is in fact a larva, making a slightly
  greater change at the last ecdysis, than at those previous. It is much to be regretted that we
  have so very small a knowledge of these most interesting Insects. Malacodermidae are probably the
  most imperfect or primitive of all beetles, and it is a point of some interest to find that in one
  of them the phenomena of metamorphosis are reduced in one sex to a minimum, while in the other
  they are&mdash;presumably at least&mdash;normal in character.</p>

  <p>Numerous larvae of most extraordinary, though diverse, shapes, bearing long processes at the
  sides of the body, and having a head capable of complete withdrawal into a slender cavity of the
  thorax, have long been known in several parts of the world, and Dr. Willey recently found in New
  Britain a species having these body-processes articulated. Though they are doubtless larvae of
  Lampyrides, none of them have ever been reared or exactly identified.</p>

  <p>A very remarkable Ceylonese Insect, <i>Dioptoma adamsi</i> Pascoe, is placed in Lampyrides, but
  can scarcely belong there, as apparently it has but five or six visible ventral segments; this
  Insect has two pairs of eyes, a large pair, with coarse facets on <span class="pagenum"
  id="page252"><span class="smaller">{252}</span></span>the under side of the head, and a
  moderate-sized pair with fine facets on the upper side. Nothing is known as to the habits of this
  curiosity, not even whether it is luminous in one or both sexes.</p>

  <p>It is believed that the perfect instar of Lampyrides takes no food at all. The larvae were
  formerly supposed to be vegetarian, but it appears probable that nearly all are carnivorous, the
  chief food being Mollusca either living or dead. The larvae are active, and in many species look
  almost as much like perfect Insects as do the imagos.</p>

  <p>The other divisions of Malacodermidae&mdash;Lycides, Drilides, Telephorides&mdash;also have
  predaceous, carnivorous larvae. All these groups are extensive. Though much neglected by
  collectors and naturalists, some 1500 species of the family Malacodermidae have been detected. We
  have about 50 in Britain, and many of them are amongst the most widely distributed and abundant of
  our native Insects. Thus, however near they may be to the primitive condition of Coleoptera, it is
  highly probable that they will continue to exist alongside of the primitive Cockroaches and
  Aptera, long after the more highly endowed forms of Insect-life have been extinguished wholesale
  by the operations of mankind on the face of the earth.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 55. Melyridae</b> (or <b>Malachiidae</b>).&mdash;<i>Six visible and moveable ventral
  abdominal segments; the basal part more or less distinctly co-adapted with the coxae.</i> These
  Insects are extremely numerous, but have been very little studied. In many works they are
  classified with Malacodermidae, but were correctly separated by Leconte and Horn, and this view is
  also taken by Dr. Verhoeff, the latest investigator. The smaller number of visible ventral
  segments appears to be due to a change at the base correlative with an adaptation between the base
  of the abdomen and the hind coxae. The characters are singularly parallel with those of Silphidae;
  but in Melyridae the antennae are filiform or serrate, <span class="pagenum" id="page253"><span
  class="smaller">{253}</span></span>not clavate. The habits in the two families are different, as
  the Melyridae are frequenters of flowers. Many of the Melyridae have the integument soft, but in
  the forms placed at the end of the family&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> <i>Zygia</i>&mdash;they are much
  firmer. Thus these Insects establish a transition from the Malacodermidae to ordinary Coleoptera.
  Although the imagos are believed to consume some products of the flowers they frequent, yet very
  little is really known, and it is not improbable that they are to some extent carnivorous. This is
  the case with the larvae that are known (Fig. 130, larva of <i>Malachius aeneus</i>). These are
  said by Perris to bear a great resemblance to those of the genus <i>Telephorus</i>, belonging to
  the Malacodermidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 56. Cleridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi five-jointed; but the basal joint of the posterior
  very indistinct, usually very small above, and closely united with the second by an oblique
  splice; the apices of joints two to four usually prolonged as membranous flaps; anterior coxae
  prominent, usually contiguous, rather large, but their cavities not prolonged externally; labial
  palpi usually with large hatchet-shaped terminal joint; ventral segments five or six, very
  mobile.</i> The Cleridae are very varied in form and colours; the antennae are usually more or
  less clubbed at the tip, and not at all serrate, but in <i>Cylidrus</i> and a few others they are
  not clubbed, and in <i>Cylidrus</i> have seven flattened joints. The student should be very
  cautious in deciding as to the number of joints in the feet in this family, as the small basal
  joint is often scarcely distinguishable, owing to the obliteration of its suture with the second
  joint. The little Alpine <i>Laricobius</i> has the anterior coxal cavities prolonged externally,
  and the coxae receive the femora to some extent, so that it connects Cleridae and Derodontidae.
  The Cleridae are predaceous, and their larvae are very active; they are specially fond of
  wood-boring Insects; that of <i>Tillus elongatus</i> (Fig. 131) enters the burrows of <i>Ptilinus
  pectinicornis</i> in search of the larva. The members of the group Corynetides frequent animal
  matter, carcases, bones, etc., and, it is said, feed thereon, but Perris's recent investigations<a
  id="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> make it probable that the larvae really eat the
  innumerable Dipterous larvae found in such refuse; it is also said that the larvae of Cleridae
  spin cocoons for their metamorphosis; but Perris has also shown that the larvae of <i>Necrobia
  ruficollis</i> really use the puparia formed <span class="pagenum" id="page254"><span
  class="smaller">{254}</span></span>by Diptera. Some of the species of <i>Necrobia</i> have been
  spread by commercial intercourse, and <i>N. rufipes</i> appears to be now one of the most
  cosmopolitan of Insects. The beautifully coloured <i>Corynetes coeruleus</i> is often found in our
  houses, and is useful, as it destroys the death-watches (<i>Anobium</i>) that are sometimes very
  injurious. <i>Trichodes apiarius</i>, a very lively-coloured red and blue beetle, destroys the
  larvae of the honey-bee, and Lampert has reared <i>Trichodes alvearius</i> from the nests of
  <i>Chalicodoma muraria</i>, a mason-bee; he records that one of its larvae, after being full
  grown, remained twenty-two months quiescent and then transformed to a pupa. Still more remarkable
  is a case of fasting of the larva of <i>Trichodes ammios</i> recorded by Mayet;<a id="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> this Insect, in its immature form, destroys <i>Acridium
  maroccanum</i>; a larva sent from Algeria to M. Mayet refused such food as was offered to it for a
  period of two and a half years, and then accepted mutton and beef as food; after being fed for
  about a year and a half thereon, it died. Some Cleridae bear a great resemblance to Insects of
  other families, and it appears probable that they resemble in one or more points the Insects on
  which they feed. The species are now very numerous, about 1000 being known, but they are rare in
  collections; in Britain we have only nine species, and some of them are now scarcely ever met
  with.</p>

  Coleoptera, and one of the most difficult to classify; though always placed amongst the
  Serricornia, it is more nearly allied to Parnidae and Byrrhidae, that are placed in Clavicornia,
  than it is to any of the ordinary families of Serricornia. It is probable that careful study will
  show that it is not natural as at present constituted, and that the old families, Dascillidae and
  Cyphonidae, now comprised in it, will have to be separated. Only about 400 species are at present
  known; but as nearly 100 of these have been detected in New Zealand, and 17 in Britain, doubtless
  the numbers in other parts of the world will prove very considerable, these Insects having been
  neglected on account of their unattractive exterior, and fragile structure. The few larvae known
  are of three or four kinds. That of <i>Dascillus cervinus</i> is subterranean, and is believed to
  live on roots; in form it is somewhat like a Lamellicorn larva, but is straight, and has a large
  head. Those of the Cyphonides are aquatic, and are remarkable for possessing antennae consisting
  of a great many joints (Fig. 132, A). Tournier describes the larva of <i>Helodes</i> as possessing
  abdominal but not thoracic spiracles, and as breathing by coming to the surface of the water and
  carrying down a bubble of air adhering to the posterior part of the body; the larva of
  <i>Hydrocyphon</i> (Fig. 132, A) <span class="pagenum" id="page256"><span
  class="smaller">{256}</span></span>possesses several finger-like pouches that can be exstulpated
  at the end of the body. It is probable that these larvae are carnivorous. The imago of this Insect
  abounds on the bushes along the banks of some of the rapid waters of Scotland; according to
  Tournier, when alarmed, it enters the water and goes beneath it for shelter. The third form of
  larva belongs to the genus <i>Eucinetus</i>, it lives on fungoid matter on wood, and has ordinary
  antennae of only four joints.<a id="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> It is very

  curved, and almost calliper-like in form.</i> This small family of less than 100 species is widely
  distributed, though confined to the warmer regions of the earth, a single species occurring in the
  extreme south of Eastern Europe. Very little is known as to the natural history. The larva of
  <i>Callirhipis dejeani</i> (Fig. 133, A) is described by Schi&ouml;dte as hard, cylindrical in form,

  <p><b>Fam. 60. Elateridae</b> (<i>Click-beetles</i>).&mdash;<i>Antennae more or less serrate along
  the inner margin, frequently pectinate, rarely filiform. Front coxae small, spherical. Thorax
  usually with hind angles more or less prolonged backwards; with a prosternal process that can be
  received in, and usually can move in, a mesosternal cavity. Hind coxa with a plate, above which
  the femur can be received. Visible ventral segments usually five, only the terminal one being
  mobile. Tarsi five-jointed.</i> This large family of Coleoptera comprises about 7000 species. Most
  of them are readily known by their peculiar shape, and by their faculty of resting on the back,
  stretching themselves out flat, and then suddenly going off with a click, and thus jerking
  themselves into the air. Some, however, do not possess this faculty, and certain of these are
  extremely difficult to recognise from a definition of the family. According to Bertkau<a
  id="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> our British <i>Lacon murinus</i> is provided near
  the tip of the upper side of the abdomen with a pair of eversible glands, comparable with those
  that are better known in Lepidopterous larvae. He states that this Insect does not try to escape
  by leaping, but shams death and "stinks away" its enemy. The glands, it would appear, become
  exhausted after the operation has been repeated many times. The extent of the leap executed by
  click-beetles differs greatly; in some species it is very slight, and only just sufficient to turn
  the Insect right side up when it has been placed on its back. In some cases the Insects go through
  the clicking movements with little or no appreciable result in the way of consequent propulsion.
  Although it is difficult to look on this clicking power as of very great value to the Elateridae,
  yet their organisation is profoundly modified so as to permit its accomplishment. The junction of
  the prothorax with the after-body involves a large number of pieces which are all more or less
  changed, so that the joint is endowed with greater mobility than usual; while in the position of
  repose, on the other hand, the two parts are firmly locked together. The thoracic stigma is of a
  highly remarkable nature, and the extensive <span class="pagenum" id="page258"><span
  class="smaller">{258}</span></span>membrane in which it is placed appears to be elastic. Although
  the mechanics of the act of leaping are still obscure, yet certain points are clear; the
  prosternal process possesses a projection, or notch, on its upper surface near the tip; as a
  preliminary to leaping, this projection catches against the edge of the mesosternal cavity, and as
  long as this position is maintained the Insect is quiescent; suddenly, however, the projection
  slips over the catch, and the prosternal process is driven with force and rapidity into the
  mesosternal cavity pressing against the front wall thereof, and so giving rise to the leap.</p>

  <p>Several larvae are well known; indeed the "wire-worms" that are sometimes so abundant in
  cultivated places are larvae of Elateridae. In this instar the form is usually elongate and nearly
  cylindrical; the thoracic segments differ but little from the others except that they bear rather
  short legs; the skin is rather hard, and usually bears punctuation or sculpture; the body
  frequently terminates in a very hard process, of irregular shape and bearing peculiar sculpture on
  its upper surface, while beneath it the prominent anal orifice is placed: this is sometimes
  furnished with hooks, the function of which has not yet been observed. The majority of these
  larvae live in decaying wood, but some are found in the earth; as a rule the growth is extremely
  slow, and the life of the larva may extend over two or more years. Some obscurity has prevailed as
  to their food; it is now considered to be chiefly flesh, though some species probably attack
  decaying roots; and it is understood that wire-worms destroy the living roots, or underground
  stems, of the crops they damage. Various kinds of Myriapods (see Vol. V. p. 29) are often called
  "wire-worm," but they may be recognised by possessing more than six legs. The larvae of the genus
  <i>Cardiophorus</i> are very different, being remarkably elongate without the peculiar terminal
  structure, but apparently composed of twenty-three segments.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Pyrophorus</i> includes some of the most remarkable of light-giving Insects. There
  are upwards of 100 species, exhibiting much diversity as to the luminous organs; some are not
  luminous at all; but all are peculiar to the New World, with the exception that there may possibly
  be luminous species, allied to the American forms, in the Fiji Islands and the New Hebrides. In
  the tropics of America the <i>Pyrophorus</i>, or Cucujos, form one of the most remarkable of the
  natural phenomena. <span class="pagenum" id="page259"><span class="smaller">{259}</span></span>The
  earliest European travellers in the New World were so impressed by these Insects that descriptions
  of their wondrous display occupy a prominent position in the accounts of writers like Oviedo,
  whose works are nearly 400 years old. Only one of the species has, however, been investigated.
  <i>P. noctilucus</i> is one of the most abundant and largest of the <i>Pyrophorus</i>, and
  possesses on each side of the thorax a round polished space from which light is given forth; these
  are the organs called eyes by the older writers. Besides these two eye-like lamps the Insect
  possesses a third source of light situate at the base of the ventral surface of the abdomen; there
  is no trace of this latter lamp when the Insect is in repose; but when on the wing the abdomen is
  bent away from the breast, and then this source of light is exposed; hence, when flying, this
  central luminous body can be alternately displayed and concealed by means of slight movements of
  the abdomen. The young larva of <i>P. noctilucus</i> is luminous, having a light-giving centre at
  the junction of the head and thorax; the older larva has also numerous luminous points along the
  sides of the body near the spiracles. It is remarkable that there should be three successive seats
  of luminescence in the life of the same individual. The eggs too are said to be luminous. The
  light given off by these Insects is extremely pleasing, and is used by the natives on nocturnal
  excursions, and by the women for ornament. The structure of the light-organs is essentially
  similar to that of the Lampyridae. The light is said to be the most economical known; all the
  energy that is used being converted into light, without any waste by the formation of heat or
  chemical rays. The subject has been investigated by Dubois,<a id="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> who comes, however, to conclusions as to the physiology of the
  luminous processes different from those that have been reached by Wielowiejski and others in their
  investigations on Glow-worms. He considers that the light is produced by the reactions of two
  special substances, luciferase and luciferine. Luciferase is of the nature of an enzyme, and
  exists only in the luminous organs, in the form, it is supposed, of extremely minute granules.
  Luciferine exists in the blood; and the light is actually evoked by the entry of blood into the
  luminous organ.</p>

  <p>We have given to this family the extension assigned to it by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page260"><span class="smaller">{260}</span></span>Schi&ouml;dte. Leconte and Horn also adopt this
  view, except that they treat Throscides as a distinct family. By most authors Eucnemides,
  Throscides, and Cebrionides are all considered distinct families, but at present it is almost
  impossible to separate them on satisfactory lines. The following table from Leconte and Horn
  exhibits the characters of the divisions so far as the imago is concerned<span

  <p>Throscides are considered to be distinguished by the mesosternum being impressed on each side
  in front for the accommodation of the posterior face of the front coxae. The genus <i>Throscus</i>
  has the antennae clavate. The classification of the Elaterides and these forms is a matter of the
  greatest difficulty, and, if the larvae are also considered, becomes even more complex. Cebrionid
  larvae are different from those of any of the other divisions, and possess laminate, not
  calliper-like, mandibles. The larvae of Eucnemides (Fig. 135) are very little known, but are
  highly remarkable, inasmuch as it is very difficult to find any mouth-opening in some of them, and
  they have no legs. The other divisions possess very few species compared with Elaterides. In
  Britain we have about sixty species of Elaterides, four of Throscides and three of Eucnemides;
  <i>Cerophytum</i> was probably a native many years ago. Neither Perothopides <span class="pagenum"
  id="page261"><span class="smaller">{261}</span></span>nor Cebrionides are represented in our
  fauna; the former of these two groups consists only of four or five North American species, and
  the Cerophytides are scarcely more numerous.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 61. Buprestidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Antennae serrate, never elongate; prothorax fitting
  closely to the after-body, with a process received into a cavity of the mesosternum so as to
  permit of no movements of nutation. Five visible ventral segments, the first usually elongate,
  closely united with the second, the others mobile. Tarsi five-jointed, the first four joints
  usually with membranous pads beneath.</i> This family is also of large extent, about 5000 species
  being known. Many of them are remarkable for the magnificence of their colour, which is usually
  metallic, and often of the greatest brilliancy; hence their wing-cases are used by our own species
  for adornment. The elytra of the eastern kinds of the genus <i>Sternocera</i> are of a very
  brilliant green colour, and are used extensively as embroidery for the dresses of ladies; the
  bronze elytra of <i>Buprestis (Euchroma) gigantea</i> were used by the native chieftains in South
  America as leg-ornaments, a large number being strung so as to form a circlet. The integument of
  the Buprestidae is very thick and hard, so as to increase the resemblance to metal. The dorsal
  plates of the abdomen are usually soft and colourless in beetles, but in Buprestidae they are
  often extremely brilliant. The metallic colour in these Insects is not due to pigment, but to the
  nature of the surface. Buprestidae appear to enjoy the hottest sunshine, and are found only where
  there is much summer heat. Australia and Madagascar are very rich in species and in remarkable
  forms of the family, while in Britain we possess only ten species, all of which are of small size,
  and nearly all are excessively rare. The family is remarkably rich in fossil forms; no less than
  28 per cent of the Mesozoic beetles found by Heer in Switzerland are referred to Buprestidae.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The larvae (Fig. 136, A) find nourishment in living vegetable matter, the rule
  being that they form galleries in or under the <span class="pagenum" id="page262"><span
  class="smaller">{262}</span></span>bark of trees and bushes, or in roots thereof; some inhabit the
  stems of herbaceous plants and one or two of the smaller forms have been discovered to live in the
  parenchyma of leaves. A few are said to inhabit dead wood, and in Australia species of
  <i>Ethon</i> dwell in galls on various plants. Buprestid larvae are of very remarkable shape, the
  small head being almost entirely withdrawn into the very broad thorax, while the abdomen is
  slender.<a id="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> A few, however, depart from this
  shape, and have the thoracic region but little or not at all broader than the other parts. The
  larvae of <i>Julodis</i>&mdash;a genus that inhabits desert or arid regions&mdash;are covered with
  hair; they have a great development of the mandibles; it is believed that they are of subterranean
  habits, and that the mandibles are used for burrowing in the earth. Only the newly hatched larva
  is, however, known.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series IV. Heteromera.</b></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tarsi of the front and middle legs with five, those of the hind legs with four,
  joints.</i></p>

  <p>This series consists of some 14,000 or 15,000 species. Twelve or more families are recognised
  in it, but the majority of the species are placed in the one great family, Tenebrionidae. The
  number of visible ventral segments is nearly always five. Several of the families of the series
  are of doubtful validity; indeed beyond that of Tenebrionidae the taxonomy of this series is
  scarcely more than a convention. The larvae may be considered as belonging to three classes; one
  in which the body is cylindrical and smooth and the integument harder than usual in larvae; a
  second in which it is softer, and frequently possesses more or less distinct pseudopods, in
  addition to the six thoracic legs; and a third group in which hypermetamorphosis prevails, the
  young larvae being the creatures long known as Triungulins, and living temporarily on the bodies
  of other Insects, so that they were formerly supposed to be parasites.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page263"><span class="smaller">{263}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 62. Tenebrionidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Front coxae short, not projecting from the cavities,
  enclosed behind. Feet destitute of lobed joints. Claws smooth.</i> This is one of the largest
  families of Coleoptera, about 10,000 species being already known. A very large portion of the
  Tenebrionidae are entirely terrestrial, wings suitable for flight being absent, and the elytra
  frequently more or less soldered. Such forms are described in systematic works as apterous.
  Unfortunately no comprehensive study has ever been made of the wings or their rudiments in these
  "apterous forms."<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> it is probable that the
  wings, or their rudiments or vestiges, always exist, but in various degrees of development
  according to the species, and that they are never used by the great majority of the terrestrial
  forms. Many of the wood-feeding Tenebrionidae, and the genera usually placed at the end of the
  family, possess wings well adapted for flight. The apterous forms are chiefly ground-beetles,
  living in dry places; they are very numerous in Africa, California, and North Mexico. Their colour
  is nearly always black, and this is probably of some physiological importance; the integuments are
  thick and hard, and if the wing-cases are taken off, it will be found that they are usually more
  or less yellow on the inner face, even when jet-black externally; the external skeleton is very
  closely fitted together, the parts that are covered consisting of very delicate membrane; the
  transition between the hard and the membranous portions of the external skeleton is remarkably
  abrupt. These ground-Tenebrionidae form a very interesting study, though, on account of their
  unattractive appearance, they have not received the attention they deserve.</p>

      (meal-worm); <b>B</b>, pupa (after Schi&ouml;dte); <b>C</b>, imago.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Many of the Tenebrionidae, notwithstanding their dark <span class="pagenum" id="page264"><span
  class="smaller">{264}</span></span>colours, are diurnal in habits, and some of them run with
  extreme velocity in places so bare and desert that the means of existence of the Insects is a
  mystery. Most of the Tenebrionidae, however, shun the light. The food is usually vegetable matter,
  and it is apparently preferred in a very dry state. Mr. Gahan has recently recorded that in
  <i>Praogena</i> the under surface of the head has the gular region striate for stridulating
  purposes. This is the only instance known of a voice-organ in this situation, and moreover is the
  only case in all the Tenebrionidae in which any sound-producing organ has been discovered. The
  larvae exhibit but little variety, they are elongate and cylindrical, with harder integument than
  is usual in Coleopterous larvae; they have six thoracic legs, and at the under side of the
  posterior extremity the anus serves as a very short pseudopod. The resemblance of these larvae to
  those of Elateridae is considerable; but though the body is terminated by one or two small
  processes, these never attain the complexity of the terminal segment of Elateridae. The common
  meal-worm&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the larva of <i>Tenebrio molitor</i>&mdash;is a very characteristic
  example of the group. The pupae are remarkable on account of peculiar projections, of varied and
  irregular form, that exist on the sides of the abdominal segments. Britain is very poor in these
  Insects; our list of them scarcely attains the number of thirty species.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 63. Cistelidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Claws comb-like.</i> The very obscure beetles forming this
  family are only separated from Tenebrionidae on account of their pectinate claws. About 500
  species of Cistelidae are recorded; the early instars, so far as known, do not differ from those
  of Tenebrionidae; the larvae are believed to live on dead wood.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 64. Lagriidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Anterior coxal cavities closed, tips of the front coxae
  free, claws smooth, penultimate joint of the tarsi broader, pubescent beneath.</i> This family has
  very little to distinguish it from Tenebrionidae, and the group Heterotarsini appears to connect
  the two. It is a small family of about 200 species, widely distributed, and represented in Britain
  by one species, <i>Lagria hirta</i>. The early instars are similar to those of the Tenebrionidae,
  except that the larva is less retiring in its habits and wanders about on foliage: it is of
  broader form than that of most of the Tenebrionidae. The pupa has long projections at the sides of
  the abdominal segments.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page265"><span class="smaller">{265}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 65. Othniidae.</b>&mdash;Only about ten species are known of this dubious family. They
  are small Insects with weak integument, and are said by Leconte and Horn to be distinguished from
  "degraded Tenebrionidae" by the more mobile abdominal segments, the hind-margins of which are
  semi-membranous. The antennae are of the clubbed shape, characteristic of "Clavicornia," but this
  also occurs in numerous undoubted Tenebrionidae. Species of <i>Othnius</i> have been found in
  Japan and Borneo, as well as in North America. Nothing is known as to their metamorphoses.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 66. &AElig;gialitidae.</b>&mdash;<i>All the coxae very widely separated; no co-adaptation
  between the sides of the abdomen and the edges of the wing-cases; five ventral segments and tip of
  a sixth visible.</i> Two minute and rare Insects from North-West America constitute this family.
  It is distinguished from Pythidae by the minute front coxae, widely separated, completely closed
  in, and deeply embedded in the prosternum.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 67. Monommidae.</b>&mdash;This is a small family of less than 100 species, the members
  of which have the details of their external structure much modified, permitting the Insect to pack
  itself up in repose in a very perfect manner. They are of small size and oval form; and are absent
  from Europe and the Antipodes. Nothing appears to be known as to the metamorphosis.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 68. Nilionidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Broad, circular Heteromera, of moderate size, with the
  front coxae but little separated, and the anterior acetabula closed, though having the appearance
  of being open in consequence of the tips of the epimera being free. The inflexed portion of the
  wing-cases remarkably broad.</i> A small family of less than fifty species, found on fungi,
  chiefly in South America. The metamorphoses are not known. It is of very doubtful validity.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 69. Melandryidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Head not constricted behind the eyes; anterior acetabula
  not closed; claws smooth. Prothorax broad behind.</i> These are loosely-fitted-together Insects,
  of moderate or small size, frequenting dry wood or fungi. About 200 species are known, found
  chiefly in temperate regions. The few described larvae are rather varied in their details and
  cannot be generalised at present. The characters of the members of this family require fresh
  investigation.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 70. Pythidae.</b>&mdash;Distinguished from Melandryidae by the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page266"><span class="smaller">{266}</span></span>prothorax being narrow behind. This is a
  small family of about 100 species, found in temperate regions in connection with timber. The
  species of <i>Rhinosimus</i> have the head prolonged in front of the antennae so as to form a
  beak. The larva of <i>Pytho depressus</i> is flat and has parallel sides; the body is terminated
  by two widely-separated sharp processes. It is found occasionally under the bark of firs in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 71. Pyrochroidae.</b>&mdash;Differs from Melandryidae by the head forming a very narrow
  neck behind, and by the penultimate tarsal joints being broad. They are feeble Insects, though
  active on the wing. They are destitute of any of the various remarkable structures found in
  Mordellidae. Only about forty species are known, and the family is confined to the north temperate
  region, being best represented in Japan. <i>Pyrochroa rubens</i> is common in some parts of
  England; the larva is found under the bark of tree-stumps; it is remarkably flat, and has the
  eighth abdominal segment unusually long, while the ninth terminates the body in the form of two
  long sharp processes.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 72. Anthicidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Head with an abrupt narrow neck; prothorax narrower than
  the elytra. Middle and hind coxae placed in definite acetabula. Claws simple.</i> These little
  Insects are numerous in species; they have little resemblance to Pyrochroidae, though the
  characters of the two families cause us to place them in proximity. There are about 1000 species
  known; though we have only about 12 in Britain, they are very numerous in the Mediterranean
  region. The family Pedilidae of Lacordaire and some others is now merged in Anthicidae. Thomson
  and Champion, on the other hand, separate some very minute Insects to form the family
  Xylophilidae, on account of certain differences in the form of the abdomen and tarsi. The
  Xylophilidae live in dead wood; the Anthicidae, on the surface of the earth, after the manner of
  ground-beetles; very little is, however, known as to their natural history.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 73. Oedemeridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Prothorax not forming sharp edges at the sides, head
  without a narrow neck. Penultimate tarsal joint broad; claws smooth.</i> These Insects usually
  have a feeble integument, and bear a certain resemblance to Malacodermidae. Less than 500 species
  are known, but they are widely distributed, and occur in both temperate and tropical regions. The
  larvae live in old wood. <i>Nacerdes melanura</i> is common on our <span class="pagenum"
  id="page267"><span class="smaller">{267}</span></span>coasts, where its larva lives in timber cast
  up by the sea, or brought down by floods, and it is able to resist immersion by the tide. It is
  remarkable from the possession of five pairs of dorsal false feet on the anterior segments, and
  two pairs on the ventral aspect. In <i>Asclera caerulea</i> there are six dorsal and three ventral
  pairs of these remarkable pseudopods. We have six species of Oedemeridae in Britain, including
  <i>Asclera</i> as well as <i>Nacerdes</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 74. Mordellidae</b> (incl. <b>Rhipiphoridae</b>).&mdash;<i>Head peculiarly formed,
  vertex lobed or ridged behind, so that in extension it reposes on the front edge of the pronotum;
  capable of great inflection and then covering the prosternum; hind coxae with laminae forming a
  sharp edge behind, frequently very large.</i> This family is a very distinct one, though it
  exhibits great variety. Lacordaire has pointed out that Rhipiphoridae cannot at present be
  satisfactorily distinguished from Mordellidae. Leconte and Horn separate the two by the fact that
  the sides of the prothorax form a sharp edge in Mordellidae, but not in Rhipiphoridae. A better
  character would perhaps be found by a study of the head, but as this would clearly result in a
  radical change in the composition of the two families it is preferable to treat them at present as
  only sub-families: if placed on a similar basis to the preceding families, the group would however
  form, not two, but several families. Besides the unusual shape of the head (Fig. 139, D) the
  ventral region of the body is remarkably formed, being very convex, and in many Mordellides
  terminating in a strong spinous process (Fig. 139, C). The elytra are, in several Rhipiphorids, of
  the groups Myoditini and Rhipidiini, reduced to a very small size, and the wings are not folded.
  The Mordellidae are remarkable for their activity; in the perfect state they usually frequent
  flowers, and fly and run with extreme rapidity. Mordellides are amongst the most numerous and
  abundant of the European Coleoptera, and in Britain the Anaspini swarm on the flowers of bushes
  and Umbelliferae. The <span class="pagenum" id="page268"><span
  class="smaller">{268}</span></span>life-histories appear to be singularly varied; but
  unfortunately they are incompletely known. The larvae of some of the Mordellids have been found in
  the stems of plants, and derive their nutriment therefrom. This is said by Schwarz to be
  undoubtedly the case with <i>Mordellistena floridensis</i>. Coquillett has found the larvae of
  <i>M. pustulata</i> in plant-stems under circumstances that render it highly probable that they
  were feeding on a Lepidopterous larva contained in the stems; and Osborn found a similar larva
  that was pretty certainly a <i>Mordellistena</i>, and fed voraciously on Dipterous larvae in the
  stems of a plant. The little that is known as to the metamorphoses of <i>Mordella</i> and
  <i>Anaspis</i> shows that they live in old wood, but does not make clear the nature of their
  food.</p>

  <p>Although it has been ascertained that the Rhipiphorides exhibit instances of remarkable
  metamorphosis, their life-histories are still very imperfectly known. Dr. Chapman has ascertained
  some particulars as to <i>Metoecus paradoxus</i>, which has long been known to prey in the larval
  state on the larvae of the common social wasps.<a id="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>
  The eggs are apparently not deposited in the nests of the wasps, but in old wood. The young larva
  is a triungulin, similar to that of the Cantharidae, we shall subsequently describe. It is not
  known how it makes its way to the wasps' nests, but it is possible that when a wasp visits some
  old wood haunted by these larvae, some of them may attach themselves to it and be carried to the
  wasps' nests. When <span class="pagenum" id="page269"><span
  class="smaller">{269}</span></span>access is gained to the cells the little <i>Metoecus</i>
  pierces the skin of one of the wasp-grubs, and entering in it feeds on the interior; after it has
  increased in size it emerges, changes its skin, and assumes a different form and habits;
  subsequently, as an external parasite, entirely devouring the wasp-larva, and then becoming a
  pupa, and finally a perfect <i>Metoecus</i>, in the cell of the wasp. The wasps, though they
  investigate the cells, do not apparently entertain any objection to the <i>Metoecus</i>, though
  there may be sometimes as many as twenty or thirty of the destroyers in a single nest. A few hours
  after the <i>Metoecus</i> has become a winged Insect and has escaped from the cells, it appears
  however, from the observations of Ern&eacute;<a id="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> on nests
  of wasps in captivity, that the wasps become hostile to the foreigners, and it is probable that in
  a state of nature these leave the nest as quickly as possible. <i>Emenadia flabellata</i>, a genus
  allied to <i>Metoecus</i>, has been discovered by Chobaut to have a similar life-history, except
  that it attacks a solitary wasp of the genus <i>Odynerus</i>.<a id="NtA_139"
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> An old record to the effect that a second species of
  <i>Emenadia</i>, <i>E. bimaculata</i>, lives in the stalks of <i>Eryngium campestre</i>, on the
  pith, is now thought to be erroneous. Fabre has found the larvae and pupae of another Rhipiphorid
  in the cells of a bee, <i>Halictus sexcinctus</i>.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable of the Rhipiphorids, from the point of view of its habits, is certainly
  <i>Symbius blattarum</i>, which is now treated as the same as an Insect previously described by
  Thunberg from specimens found in amber and called <i>Ripidius pectinicornis</i>. This species is
  parasitic in cockroaches; the male and female are very different, the former being an active
  winged Insect, while the female is worm-like, differing but little from the larva, and never
  leaving the body of the cockroach. It is to be regretted that the life-history is not better
  known. The species has been found on board ship in vessels coming from India; the male has been
  met with in several European countries, but the female is excessively rare.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 75. Cantharidae or Meloidae</b> (<i>Blister-beetles</i>, <i>Oil-beetles</i>).-<i>-Head
  with an abrupt neck; elytra and sides of the abdomen without any coadaptation; each claw of the
  feet with a long appendage closely applied beneath it.</i> This distinct family consists of
  Heteromera with soft integument, and is remarkable for the fact that many of its members contain a
  substance that when extracted <span class="pagenum" id="page270"><span
  class="smaller">{270}</span></span>and applied to the human skin, possesses the power of raising
  blisters. The life-history is highly remarkable, the most complex forms of hyper-metamorphosis
  being exhibited. The species now known amount to about 1500; there can be no difficulty in
  recognising a member of the family by the above characters, except that in a very few cases each
  claw bears a projecting tooth, instead of an elongate appendage parallel with itself. The
  penultimate tarsal joint scarcely ever broader than the preceding; the colour and style of
  markings are extremely varied. There are two very distinct sub-families, Cantharides and Meloides;
  the former are winged Insects, and are frequently found on flowers or foliage. The Meloides are
  wingless, and consequently terrestrial; they have a very short metasternum, so that the middle
  coxae touch the hind; and they also have very peculiar wing-cases, one of the two overlapping the
  other at the base; in a few Meloids the wing-cases are merely rudiments.</p>

  <p>The post-embryonic development of these Insects is amongst the most remarkable of modern
  entomological discoveries. The first steps were made by Newport in 1851,<a id="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> and the subject has since been greatly advanced by Fabre,
  Riley, and others. As an example of these peculiar histories, we may cite Riley's account<a
  id="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> of <i>Epicauta vittata</i> (Fig. 140), a
  blister-beetle living at the expense of North American locusts of the genus <i>Caloptenus</i>. The
  locust lays its eggs underground, in masses surrounded by an irregular capsule, and the
  <i>Epicauta</i> deposits its eggs in spots frequented by the locust, but not in special proximity
  to the eggs thereof. In a few days the eggs of the blister-beetle hatch, giving rise to little
  larvae of the kind called triungulin (Fig. 140, A), because each leg is terminated by three tarsal
  spines or claws. In warm, sunny weather these triungulins become very active; they run about on
  the surface of the ground exploring all its cracks, penetrating various spots and burrowing, till
  an egg-pod of the locust is met with; into this the triungulin at once eats its way, and commences
  to devour an egg. Should two or more triungulins enter the same egg-pod, battles occur till only
  one is left.</p>

  <p>After a few days passed in devouring a couple of eggs, the triungulin sheds its skin and
  appears as a different larva (Fig. 140, B), with soft skin, short legs, small eyes, and different
  form and proportions; a second moult takes place after about a week, but is not accompanied by any
  very great change of form, though the larva is now curved, less active, and in form like a larva
  of Scarabaeidae; when another moult occurs the fourth instar appears as a still more helpless form
  of larva (Fig. 140, D), which increases rapidly in size, and when full grown leaves the remains of
  the egg-pod it has been living on, and forms a small cavity near by; here it lies on one side
  motionless, but gradually contracting, till the skin separates and is pushed down to the end of
  the body, disclosing a completely helpless creature that has been variously called a semi-pupa,
  pseudo-pupa, or coarctate larva (Fig. 140, C); in this state the winter is passed. In spring the
  skin of the coarctate larva bursts, and there crawls out of it a sixth instar which resembles the
  fourth (Fig. 140, D), except in the somewhat reduced size and greater whiteness. It is worthy of
  remark that the skin it has deserted retains its original form almost intact. In this sixth instar
  the larva is rather active and burrows about, <span class="pagenum" id="page272"><span
  class="smaller">{272}</span></span>but does not take food, and in the course of a few days again
  moults and discloses the true pupa (Fig. 140, E). As usual in Coleoptera this instar lasts but a
  short time, and in five or six days the perfect beetle appears (Fig. 140, F). It is extremely
  difficult to frame any explanation of this complex development; there are, it will be noticed, no
  less than five stages interposed between the first larval instar and the pupal instar, and the
  creature assumes in the penultimate one a quasi-pupal state, to again quit it for a return to a
  previous state. It is possible to look on the triungulin and the pupal instars as special
  adaptations to external conditions; but it is not possible to account for the intermediate instars
  in this way, and we must look on them as necessitated by the physiological processes going on
  internally. Nothing, however, is known as to these. It may be well to mention that, after
  describing and figuring (<i>loc. cit.</i>) this series of instars, Riley changed his views as to
  their nomenclature.<a id="NtA_142" href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> The following summary of
  the metamorphosis, to which we have added the two nomenclatures of Riley&mdash;the original one,

  <p>M. Fabre has succeeded in elucidating the history of <i>Sitaris humeralis</i>, a Cantharid that
  lives at the expense of bees of the genus <i>Anthophora</i>.<a id="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> The eggs of the <i>Sitaris</i> are deposited in the earth in
  close proximity to the entrances to the bees' nests, about August. They are very numerous, a
  single female producing, it is believed, upwards of 2000 eggs. In about a month&mdash;towards the
  end of September&mdash;they hatch, producing a tiny triungulin of black colour; the larvae do not,
  however, move away, but, without taking any food, hibernate in a heap, remaining in this state
  till the following April or May, when they become active. Although they are close to the abodes of
  the bees they do not enter them, but seek to attach themselves <span class="pagenum"
  id="page273"><span class="smaller">{273}</span></span>to any hairy object that may come near them,
  and thus a certain number of them get on to the bodies of the <i>Anthophora</i> and are carried to
  its nest. They attach themselves with equal readiness to any other hairy Insect, and it is
  probable that very large numbers perish in consequence of attaching themselves to the wrong
  Insects. The bee in question is a species that nests in the ground and forms cells, in each of
  which it places honey and lays an egg, finally closing the receptacle. It is worthy of remark that
  in the case of the <i>Anthophora</i> observed by M. Fabre, the male appears about a month before
  the female, and it is probable that the vast majority of the predatory larvae attach themselves to
  the male, but afterwards seize a favourable opportunity, transfer themselves to the female, and so
  get carried to the cells of the bee. When she deposits an egg on the honey, the triungulin glides
  from the body of the bee on to the egg, and remains perched thereon as on a raft, floating on the
  honey, and is then shut in by the bee closing the cell. This remarkable act of slipping on to the
  egg cannot be actually witnessed, but the experiments and observations of the French naturalist
  leave little room for doubt as to the matter really happening in the way described. The egg of the
  bee forms the first nutriment of the tiny triungulin, which spends about eight days in consuming
  its contents; never quitting it, because contact with the surrounding honey is death to the little
  creature, which is entirely unfitted for living thereon. After this the triungulin undergoes a
  moult and appears as a very different creature, being now a sort of vesicle with the spiracles
  placed near the upper part; so that it is admirably fitted for floating on the honey (Vol. V. Fig.
  86, 10). In about forty days, that is, towards the middle of July, the honey is consumed, and the
  vesicular larva after a few days of repose changes to a pseudo-pupa (11 of the fig. cited) within
  the larval skin. After remaining in this state for about a month, some of the specimens go through
  the subsequent changes, and appear as perfect Insects in August or September. The majority delay
  this subsequent metamorphosis till the following spring, wintering as pseudo-pupae and continuing
  the series of changes in June of the following year; at that time the pseudo-pupa returns to a
  larval form (12 of the fig. cited), differing comparatively little from the second instar. The
  skin, though detached, is again not shed, so that this ultimate larva is enclosed in two <span
  class="pagenum" id="page274"><span class="smaller">{274}</span></span>dead skins; in this curious
  envelope it turns round, and in a couple of days, having thus reversed its position, becomes
  lethargic and changes to the true pupa, and in about a month subsequent to this appears as a
  perfect Insect, at about the same time of the year as it would have done had only one year,
  instead of two, been occupied by its metamorphosis.  M. Fabre employs the term, third larva, for
  the instar designated by Riley Scolytoid larva, but this is clearly an inconvenient mode of naming
  the instar. <i>Sitaris humeralis</i> is now very rare in Britain, but it seems formerly to have
  been more common, and it is not improbable that its triungulin may have been the "<i>Pediculus
  melittae</i>," that was believed by Kirby to be a sort of bee-louse. Some species of the genus
  <i>Meloe</i> are still common in Britain, and the Insects may be seen with heavy distended abdomen
  grazing on herbage in the spring. The females are enormously prolific, a single one producing, it
  is believed, about 10,000 eggs. <i>Meloe</i> is also dependent on <i>Anthophora</i>, and its
  life-history seems on the whole to be similar to that of <i>Sitaris</i>; the eggs are, however,
  not necessarily deposited in the neighbourhood of the bees' nests, and the triungulins distribute
  themselves on all sorts of unsuitable Insects, so that it is possible that not more than one in a
  thousand succeeds in getting access to the <i>Anthophora</i> nest. It would be supposed that it
  would be a much better course for these bee-frequenting triungulins to act like those of
  <i>Epicauta</i>, and hunt for the prey they are to live on; but it must be remembered that they
  cannot live on honey; the one tiny egg is their object, and this apparently can only be reached by
  the method indicated by Fabre.  The history of these Insects certainly forms a most remarkably
  instructive chapter in the department of animal instinct, and it is a matter for surprise that it
  should not yet have attracted the attention of comparative psychologists.  The series of actions,
  to be performed once and once only in a lifetime by an uninstructed, inexperienced atom, is such
  that we should <i>a priori</i> have denounced it as an impossible means of existence, were it not
  shown that it is constantly successful.  It is no wonder that the female <i>Meloe</i> produces
  5000 times more eggs than are necessary to continue the species without diminution in the number
  of its individuals, for the first and most important act in the complex series of this
  life-history is accomplished by an extremely indiscriminating instinct; the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page275"><span class="smaller">{275}</span></span>newly hatched <i>Meloe</i> has to get on to
  the body of the female of one species of bee; but it has no discrimination whatever of the kind of
  object it requires, and as a matter of fact, passes with surprising rapidity on to any hairy
  object that touches it; hence an enormous majority of the young are wasted by getting on to all
  sorts of other Insects; these larvae have been found in numbers on hairy Coleoptera as well as on
  flies and bees of wrong kinds; the writer has ascertained by experiment that a camel's-hair brush
  is as eagerly seized, and passed on to, by the young <i>Meloe</i> as a living Insect is.</p>

  <p>The histories of several other Cantharids have been more or less completely discovered. Fabre
  has found the larva of <i>Cerocoma schaefferi</i> attacking the stores of provisions laid up by a
  fossorial wasp of the genus <i>Tachytes</i>, and consisting of Orthoptera of the family Mantidae.
  The student who wishes for further information may refer to M. Beauregard's work on this family.<a
  id="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some half-dozen species of the genus <i>Cephaloon</i> found in Siberia, Japan, and North
  America, have, by some authorities, been separated as the family Cephaloidae. Nothing is known as
  to the metamorphosis of these rare beetles; and at present it is not necessary to distinguish them
  from Cantharid&aelig;.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 76. Trictenotomidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Large Heteromera, with powerful free
  projecting mandibles; the antennae long, but with the terminal three joints short, with angular
  projections on one side.</i> This family includes only two genera and seven or eight species. They
  are very remarkable Insects; <i>Autocrates aenea</i> being three inches long. The family is of
  considerable interest, as it seems to have no affinity with any other Coleoptera. The appearance
  of the species somewhat reminds one of Lucanidae, or Prionides; but Trictenotomidae have even less
  relation to those beetles than they have to the members of the Heteromerous series. The
  Trictenotomidae appear to be found only in the primitive forests of the Indian and Indo-Malayan
  regions. Nothing is known as to their life-histories.</p>

    <p class="sp0"><i>Tarsi apparently four-jointed, the three basal joints usually densely set with

    its base instead of at its extremity. Head not forming a definite prolonged beak; its labrum
    visible, the palpi rarely (and even then not completely) occluded in the mouth.</i></p>

  <p>This great series of beetles includes something like 35,000 species. It approaches, like all
  the other series, the Polymorpha, especially the family Erotylidae placed therein, but in the
  great majority of cases there is no difficulty in recognising its members. The tarsi have never
  the Heteromerous formula, the head is not constructed like that of Rhynchophora, nor the mouth and
  feet like those of Adephaga; the antennae are different from those of the Lamellicorns. The tarsi
  are really five-jointed, for careful inspection shows that the long claw-joint has at its extreme
  base a small nodule, which is undoubtedly the fourth joint (Fig. 142, B). In speaking of the
  joints it is, however, customary not to refer to this small and functionally useless joint at all,
  and to call the claw-joint the fourth; when the little joint is referred to it may be called the
  true fourth joint.</p>

  <p>Nearly the whole of the enormous number of species of this series are directly dependent on the
  vegetable kingdom for their nutriment; they are therefore well styled Phytophaga. This term is,
  however, restricted by some systematists to the family we have called Chrysomelidae. Although
  there is enormous variety in this series, three families only can be at all naturally
  distinguished, and this with difficulty. Of these the Bruchidae are seed-feeders, the
  Chrysomelidae, as a rule, leaf-feeders, the Cerambycidae wood and stem-feeders. The number of
  exceptions to this rule is but small, though certain Cerambycidae and certain Chrysomelidae live
  on roots.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 77. Bruchidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Prosternum extremely short; in front perpendicular; behind
  the coxae, forming merely a transverse lamina with pointed extremity. Hind femora more or less
  <span class="pagenum" id="page277"><span class="smaller">{277}</span></span>thickened.</i> This
  comparatively small family includes about 700 species of small, unattractive beetles. The larvae
  live in seeds; hence some of the species are liable to be transported by means of commerce; some
  of them do considerable injury; peas and beans being specially subject to their attacks. They are
  able to complete their growth with a very small amount of nutriment, some of them consuming only a
  portion a little larger than themselves of a bean or pea. The larvae are fat maggots without legs,
  but Riley has discovered that the young larvae of <i>Bruchus pisi</i> and <i>B. fabae</i> have,
  when first hatched, three pairs of legs which are subsequently lost. They also have peculiar
  spinous processes on the pronotum. Both of these characteristics may be correlative with the
  transient differences in the activities of the larva, for the little creature is not at first
  located in the pea, but mines a gallery in the pod, in which it moves about, subsequently entering
  the pea and losing its legs. There is a good deal of difference in these respects between the two
  species&mdash;<i>B. pisi</i> and <i>B. fabae</i>&mdash;examined by Riley, and as but little is
  known of the life-histories of other Bruchidae it is probable that still greater variety prevails.
  Heeger has found that <i>Bruchus lentis</i> sometimes requires two seeds to enable it to complete
  its growth; it is, notwithstanding its legless state when half-grown, able to migrate by dropping
  to the earth, and dragging itself along by its mandibles till it comes to another pod into which
  it bites its way.</p>

  <p>The family has, until recently, been placed in the <span class="pagenum" id="page278"><span
  class="smaller">{278}</span></span>Rhynchophorous series, with which it has, however, no direct
  connection. On the other hand, it is so closely connected with Chrysomelidae that it is not
  possible to indicate good characters to distinguish the two at present. The Australian genus
  <i>Carpophagus</i>, and the large South American species of <i>Caryoborus</i> appear to be quite
  indistinguishable as families, though Lacordaire and Chapuis placed one in Bruchidae, the other in
  Chrysomelidae. The definition we have given applies, therefore, to the majority of the family, but
  not to the aberrant forms just mentioned. The European genus <i>Urodon</i> appears to belong to
  Anthribidae, not to Bruchidae. The family Bruchidae is called Mylabridae by some.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 78. Chrysomelidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Antennae moderately long; eyes moderately large,
  usually not at all surrounding the insertion of the antennae; upper surface usually bare,
  frequently brightly coloured and shining.</i> This enormous family comprises about 18,000 species
  of beetles, in which the form and details of structure are very varied. No satisfactory character
  for distinguishing Chrysomelidae from Cerambycidae has yet been discovered, although the two
  families are certainly distinct and natural. Most of the Chrysomelidae live on foliage; few of
  them are more than half an inch long, whereas the Cerambycidae are wood-feeders and usually of
  more elongate form and larger size. The potato beetle, or Colorado beetle, that occasioned so much
  destruction in North America some thirty years ago, and the introduction of which into Europe was
  anticipated with much dread, is a good example of the Chrysomelidae. The turnip flea, a tiny
  hopping beetle, is among the smallest forms of the family, and is a member of another very
  extensive subdivision of Chrysomelidae, viz. Halticides. The term Phytophaga is by many
  naturalists limited to Chrysomelidae, the Cerambycidae being excluded. The classification of the
  family is but little advanced, but the enormous number of species of Chrysomelidae are placed in
  four divisions, viz.<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The larvae of about 100 species of the family are known; they are arranged in accordance with
  their habits, by Chapuis,<a id="NtA_145" href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> in six groups,
  viz.:</p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>1. Elongate larvae, living under water, and there undergoing their metamorphosis.
    (Donaciides.)</p>
    <p>2. Larvae mining in leaves, and undergoing their metamorphosis in the leaf. (Hispides and
    some Halticides.)</p>
    <p>3. Short convex larvae, frequently with leathery and pigmented integuments, living exposed on
    plants. (Most of the Cyclica.)</p>
    <p>4. Larvae of short form; covering the body with excrementitious matter. (Some
    Criocerides.)</p>
    <p>5. Peculiar larvae of short form, spiny, and protecting their bodies by excrementitious
    matter attached by a special apparatus, the excrement itself being modified so as to be suitable
    for retention. (Cassidides.)</p>
    <p class="sp0">6. Elongate, pallid, larvae with curved abdomen; living in shell-like cases, and
    undergoing metamorphosis therein.  (Most of the Camptosomes, the habits of which are known.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Though our knowledge of these larvae extends to only about 100 out of 18,000 species, the above
  category by no means includes all the kinds of larvae; Captain Xambeu having recently discovered
  that the larva of <i>Chrysochus pretiosus</i> lives in the earth feeding on roots after the manner
  of a <i>Rhizotrogus</i> larva, which it resembles. The larva of <i>Sagra splendida</i> lives <span
  class="pagenum" id="page280"><span class="smaller">{280}</span></span>inside the stems of
  <i>Dioscorea batatas</i>, in swellings; the group Sagrides, to which it belongs, is a very
  anomalous one.</p>

  <p>i. Eupoda. The beetles of the genus <i>Donacia</i> are of special interest. They form, with the
  genus <i>Haemonia</i>, a peculiar group, well represented in Europe, and also in our own country.
  They are all connected with aquatic plants, the species of <i>Haemonia</i> living entirely under
  water, while the <i>Donacia</i> live in the imago-state an a&euml;rial life, though many of them enter
  the water with great readiness, and, it is said, are able to take wing from the surface. The
  larvae live on the roots of aquatic plants, and derive not only nutriment but air therefrom; they
  pass several months as pupae (or as resting larvae waiting for pupation), under water in cocoons
  which they construct, and which, incredible as it may seem, are filled with air, not water. Exact
  details as to the construction of these cocoons are wanting. It was formerly absurdly supposed
  that the larva swelled itself out to the size of the cocoon it was about to make, and so served as
  a mould, subsequently contracting. The observations of Schmidt-Schwedt<a id="NtA_146"
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> make it, however, more probable that the plant itself
  furnishes the air which, under pressure of the water (so he supposes), fills the cocoon; the larva
  wounds the root, piercing to an air-vessel and then constructs the cocoon on this spot, leaving to
  the last moment an orifice, according to Schmidt, as an exit for the water. The larva uses a
  similar artifice for obtaining air; it has no gills, but is provided near the extremity of the
  body with two sharp chitinous processes which it drives into the root of the plant till it
  penetrates an air-vessel. Schmidt thinks the processes serve as conduits to conduct the air to the
  tracheae, but Dewitz thinks the air enters the larva in a more normal manner, by means of a stigma
  placed at the base of the piercing process. A similar larva exists in <i>Haemonia</i>; which genus
  is additionally interesting from the fact that the imago lives entirely submerged. It is not known
  how it breathes. This genus is the only member of the Chrysomelidae that does not possess the
  structure of the feet that is characteristic of the Phytophaga. The late Professor Babington about
  sixty years ago found <i>H. curtisi</i> at Cley on the Norfolk coast on submerged <i>Potamogeton
  pectinatus</i>, but it has not been met with there for a great many years.</p>

  <p>The larvae of Criocerides are of two kinds, in one of which the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page281"><span class="smaller">{281}</span></span>body is peculiarly shaped in conformity with
  the curious habit of using the excrement as a covering. The larva is less elongate than usual, and
  has the anus placed on the upper surface, and formed so that the excrement when voided is pushed
  forward on to the Insect; here it is retained by means of a slimy matter, and a thick coat
  entirely covering the creature, is ultimately formed. The larva of <i>Lema melanopa</i> is not
  uncommon about Cambridge, where it feeds on the leaves of growing corn. It is a remarkable fact
  that even in one genus the species have some of them this habit, but others not. The species of
  <i>Crioceris</i> living on lilies&mdash;<i>C. merdigera</i>, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;are noted for
  possessing it; while <i>C. asparagi</i> does not protect itself in this way, but emits fluid from
  its mouth when disturbed. This larva is a serious nuisance in some localities to the cultivators
  of asparagus. The eggs are deposited on the stems of the plant&mdash;as shown in our
  figure&mdash;sometimes in great numbers.</p>

  <p>The perfect Insects of many of the Criocerides possess a stridulating organ. Two contiguous
  areas at the base of the last dorsal segment, where they can be rubbed by the tips of the elytra,
  are slightly elevated and bear very close and fine straight lines.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>ii. The Camptosomes, as we have already noticed, are distinguished by a peculiar structure of
  the abdomen. This character appears to be connected with a very remarkable habit, viz. the
  formation of a case to envelop the egg. The tip of the abdomen is somewhat curved downwards, and,
  in the female, bears a hollow near the extremity; when an egg is extruded the female holds it in
  this hollow by means of the hind legs, and envelops it with a covering said to be excrementitious.
  When the larva hatches, it remains within this case, and <span class="pagenum" id="page282"><span
  class="smaller">{282}</span></span>subsequently enlarges it by additions from its own body. The
  beautiful Insects of the genus <i>Cryptocephalus</i>, which is fairly well represented in Britain,
  belong to this division. The exotic group Megalopodes is incorrectly placed in Camptosomes; the
  side pieces of the prothorax meet in it behind the middle coxae, as they do in Rhynchophora. The
  species of Megalopodes stridulate by means of an area on the base of the meso-scutellum rubbed by
  a ridge inside the pronotum, as in the Cerambycid&aelig;.</p>

  <p>iii. The division Cyclica includes the great majority of Chryomelidae; we have not less than
  170 species in Britain. The larvae live, like those of Lepidoptera, at the expense of foliage, and
  the species frequently multiply to such an extent as to be injurious. Some of them are destroyed
  in great numbers by Hymenopterous parasites, the Braconid genus <i>Perilitus</i> being one of the
  best known of these; in some cases the parasite deposits its eggs in either the larva or perfect
  Insect of the beetle, and the metamorphoses of the parasites in the latter case are sometimes, if
  not usually, completed, the larvae emerging from the living beetles for pupation.</p>

  <p>iv. The Cryptostomes, though comparatively few in number of species, include some very
  remarkable beetles. There are two groups, Hispides and Cassidides. The former are almost peculiar
  to the tropics and are not represented by any species in the British fauna. The head in this group
  is not concealed; but in the Cassidides the margins of the upper surface are more or less
  expanded, so that the head is usually completely hidden by the expansion of the pronotum. Both the
  groups are characterised by the antennae being inserted very near together, and by the short
  claw-joint of the feet. <i>Hispa</i> is one of the most extensive of the numerous genera of
  Hispides, and is remarkable from the imago being covered on the surface with long, sharp spines.
  But little is known as to the metamorphosis, beyond the fact already alluded to, that the larvae
  of several species mine the interior of leaves. The larva of <i>Hispa testacea</i>, according to
  Perris,<a id="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> makes use of the leaves of <i>Cistus
  salvifolius</i> in Southern Europe; it is broad and flat, and possessed of six short legs. The
  eggs are not deposited by the parents inside the leaves, but are probably attached to various
  parts of the plant. After hatching, the young larva enters a leaf, and feeds on the parenchyma
  without rupturing <span class="pagenum" id="page283"><span class="smaller">{283}</span></span>the
  epidermis; but when it has consumed about three-fourths of the soft interior of the leaf it
  ruptures the epidermis of the upper surface, and seeks another leaf; this found, it places itself
  on the midrib, tears the upper epidermis, and lodges itself in the leaf. In the case of this
  second leaf it attacks the parenchyma in the neighbourhood of the petiole, and so forms an
  irregular tube which has an open mouth, the point of entry. In this tube it undergoes its
  metamorphosis. Each larva, it is said, always makes use of two leaves, and of two opposed leaves.
  A knowledge of the habits of some of the larger of the exotic Hispides would be of much
  interest.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Cassidides, in addition to the curious marginal expansion of their upper surface, have the
  power of withdrawing the head into the thorax, and hence they are often called shield or
  tortoise-beetles. They exhibit considerable variety in form and colour, and some of them display a
  peculiar metallic reflection of great delicacy and beauty; this disappears entirely after death,
  but it may be restored by thoroughly moistening the dead Insect. The colour, therefore, probably
  depends on the presence of water in the integument. The larvae of Cassidides are notorious on
  account of their habit of covering their bodies with dried excrement, for which purpose they are
  provided with a forked <span class="pagenum" id="page284"><span
  class="smaller">{284}</span></span>process at the posterior extremity; this serves to place the
  protecting matter in a proper position and to retain it there. The excrement assumes in various
  species forms so peculiar that they cannot be considered merely incidental. In several species
  this covering-matter is like lichen. This is the case with <i>Dolichotoma palmarum</i>, the larva
  of which has, in place of the usual fork, a more complex appendage on the back for the purpose of
  preparing and retaining its peculiar costume. The pupae, too, sometimes retain the larval skin. An
  extremely remarkable pupa of a Cassidid&mdash;possibly of the genus <i>Aspidomorpha</i>&mdash;was
  recently found by Dr. Arthur Willey in New Britain (Fig. 144). The back of the pupa is covered
  with a complex appendage, so that the creature has no resemblance to an Insect; this appendage is
  perhaps capable of being moved, or even extended (Fig. 144, A), during life. Whether it may be
  formed by the retention of portions of the moulted skins of the larva we cannot say with
  certainty.</p>

      <i>Porphyraspis tristis</i> lives.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The most remarkable of the Cassidid coverings yet discovered are those formed by certain small
  beetles of the tropical American genus <i>Porphyraspis</i>. <i>P. tristis</i> is apparently a
  common Insect at Bahia, where it lives on a cocoa-palm. The larva is short and broad, and
  completely covers itself with a very dense coat of fibres, each many times the length of the body,
  and elaborately curved so as to form a round nest under which the larva lives. On examination it
  is found that these long threads are all attached to the anal extremity of the Insect, and there
  seems no alternative to believing that each thread is formed by small pieces of fibre that have
  passed through the alimentary canal, and are subsequently stuck together, end to end. The process
  of forming these long fibres, each one from scores of pieces of excrement, and giving them the
  appropriate curve, is truly remarkable. The fibres nearest to the body of the larva are abruptly
  curled so as to fit exactly, and make an even surface; but the outside fibres stand out in a
  somewhat bushy fashion. The construction is much like that of a tiny bird's nest. Se&ntilde;or Lacerda
  informed the writer that the larva makes a nest as soon as it is hatched. Another
  <i>Porphyraspis</i>&mdash;<i>P. palmarum</i>&mdash;has been recorded as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page285"><span class="smaller">{285}</span></span>forming similar nests on a species of
  <i>Thrinax</i> in St. Domingo. Cand&egrave;ze says<a id="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a>
  that when it has completed its growth the larva ejects on to the leaf a quantity of semi-liquid
  matter, and this, on drying, sticks the nest to the leaf, so that the metamorphosis is effected
  under shelter.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 79. Cerambycidae</b> (<i>Longicorns</i>).&mdash;<i>Form usually oblong, not much curved
  in outline at the sides; surface very frequently rendered dull by a very minute hairiness, which
  often forms a pattern; antennae usually long, and their insertion much embraced by the eyes.</i>
  This great family of beetles includes some 12,000 or 13,000 known species. The elegance and
  variety of their forms and the charm of their colours have caused them to attract much attention,
  so that it is probable that a larger proportion of the existing species have been obtained than is
  the case in any other of the great families of Coleoptera. Still it is not likely that one-half of
  the living forms are known. It is not possible at present to point out any one character of
  importance to distinguish Cerambycidae from Chrysomelidae, though the members of the two families
  have, as a rule, but little resemblance in external appearance. Most of them live on, or in, wood,
  though many are nourished in the stems of herbaceous plants. The larvae live a life of
  concealment, and are soft, whitish grubs with powerful mandibles, and usually with a comparatively
  small head, which is not much exserted from the thorax. Most of them are without legs, but a good
  many have three pairs of small legs, and there are numerous cases in which the surface of the body
  is furnished above or below with swellings believed to act as pseudopods (Fig. 84), and help the
  larvae to move about in their galleries; but this is probably not the sole function of these
  organs, as their surface is varied in character, and often not of a kind that appears specially
  adapted to assist in locomotion. There is a slight general resemblance between the larvae of
  Cerambycidae and those of Buprestidae, and when the thorax of a Longicorn larva is unusually
  broad, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Astynomus</i>, this similarity is very pronounced.</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page286"><span class="smaller">{286}</span></span></div>

  <p>The modes of life of Cerambycid larvae exhibit considerable variety, and much perfection of
  instinct is displayed by the larvae, as well as by the mother beetles. The larvae of <i>Saperda
  populnea</i>, are common in certain woods in the South of England in the stems of aspen; they
  consume only a small quantity of the interior of the stem, and are probably nourished by an afflux
  of sap to the spot where they are situated. <i>Elaphidion villosum</i> is called the oak-pruner in
  North America. The parent beetle lays an egg near the axilla of a leaf-stalk or small stem, and
  the young larva enters this and feeds on the tender material; as it grows it enters a larger limb,
  and makes an incision within this in such a manner that the wood falls to the ground with the
  larva within it, the dead wood serving subsequently as pabulum and as a shelter, within which the
  metamorphosis is completed. The species of the American genus <i>Oncideres</i> are called
  girdlers, because the parent beetle, after laying an egg in a small branch, girdles this round
  with a deep incision, so that the portion containing the larva sooner or later falls to the
  ground. The growth of a Longicorn larva frequently takes more than a year, and under certain
  circumstances it may be enormously prolonged. <i>Monohammus confusus</i> has been known to issue
  from wooden furniture in a dwelling-house when the furniture was fifteen years old. Individuals of
  another Longicorn have issued from the wood of a table, twenty and even twenty-eight years after
  the felling of the tree from which the furniture was made. Sereno Watson has related a case from
  which it appears probable that the life of a Longicorn beetle extended over at least forty-five
  years.<a id="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> It is generally assumed that the
  prolongation of life in these cases is due to the beetle resting quiescent for long after it has
  completed the metamorphosis. Recent knowledge, however, renders it more probable that it is the
  larval life that is prolonged; the larva continuing to feed, but gaining little or no nutriment
  from the dry wood in these unnatural conditions. Mr. C. O. Waterhouse had for some years a
  Longicorn larva under observation, feeding in this way in the wood of a boot-tree;<a id="NtA_150"
  href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> the burrows in the wood contained a great deal of minute dust
  indicating that the larva passed much matter through the alimentary canal, probably with little
  result in the way of nutriment.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page287"><span class="smaller">{287}</span></span></div>

  <p>There are numerous Longicorns that bear a great resemblance in form and colour to Insects to
  which they are not related. Haensch<a id="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> has noticed
  that species of the genus <i>Odontocera</i> resemble various Hymenoptera, one species being called
  <i>O. braconoides</i>; he also observed that these Hymenoptera-like Longicorns, instead of
  withdrawing their underwings under the elytra as beetles generally do, vibrate them rapidly like
  Hymenoptera. A large number of Longicorns stridulate loudly by rubbing a ridge inside the pronotum
  on a highly specialised, striate surface at the base of the scutellum, and therefore covered up
  when the Insect is contracted in repose. A few produce noise by rubbing the hind femora against
  the edges of the elytra, somewhat after the fashion of grasshoppers. In this case there appears to
  be comparatively little speciality of structure, the femora bearing, however, more or less
  distinct small granules. The species of the Hawaiian genus <i>Plagithmysus</i> produce sound in
  both these manners, the thoracic stridulating organ being beautifully developed, while in some
  species the margin of the elytra and base of the femora are also well adapted for the purpose of
  sound-production, and in a few species of the genus there are also highly-developed stridulating
  surfaces on the hind and middle coxae. This is the only case in which a beetle is known to possess
  more than one set of sound-organs in the imago state.</p>

  <p>Three divisions of this family are distinguished, viz.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>1. Front coxae large and transverse; prothorax with distinct side margins. .......... <span
    class="wnw">Sub-fam. 1. Prionides.</span></p>
    <p>2. Front coxae not greatly extended transversely, thorax not margined; last joint of
    maxillary palpus not pointed, usually broader (more or less) than the preceding joint.
    .......... <span class="wnw">Sub-fam. 2. Cerambycides.</span></p>
    <p class="sp0">3. Front coxae usually round and deeply embedded; last joint of maxillary palpus
    pointed; front tibiae with a more or less distinct, slanting groove on the inner side.
    .......... <span class="wnw">Sub-fam. 3. Lamiides.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Prionides are on the average considerably larger in size than the members of the other
  divisions, and they include some of the largest of Insects. The Amazonian <i>Titanus giganteus</i>
  and the Fijian <i>Macrotoma heros</i> are amongst the most gigantic. Some of the Prionides have a
  great development of the mandibles in the male sex analogous to that we have already noticed in
  Lucanidae. The larvae of the large Prionides appear in various parts of the world to have been a
  favourite food with native <span class="pagenum" id="page288"><span
  class="smaller">{288}</span></span>tribes, and Lumholz states that they are really good eating. In
  consequence of the destruction of forests that has progressed so largely of late years these
  gigantic Prionides have become much rarer.</p>

  <p>Several aberrant forms are included in Prionides. The genus <i>Parandra</i> has five-jointed
  tarsi; the third joint being much smaller than usual, so that the fourth joint is not concealed by
  it. The Brazilian <i>Hypocephalus armatus</i> was for long a subject of dispute as to its natural
  position, and was placed by different authorities in widely-separated families of Coleoptera. The
  structure of this aberrant Longicorn seems to be only explicable on the hypothesis of warfare
  amongst the males.<a id="NtA_152" href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> Nothing is, however, known
  as to the habits and history of the Insect, and only one or two specimens of the female have yet
  been obtained.</p>

  <p>The family Spondylidae has been proposed for some of these aberrant Longicorns, but as it
  includes but very few, and highly discrepant, species, it is neither natural nor of much use for
  systematic purposes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Lamiides are the most highly specialised division of the Longicorns, and
  includes the larger number of the species. The front of the head is usually placed at right angles
  to the vertex, and in some cases (groups Hippopsini, Spalacopsini) it is strongly inflexed, so
  that the mouth is placed on the under side of the head. The extension of the eyes round the
  antennae is accompanied by very curious shapes of those organs, and not infrequently each eye is
  divided into two more or less widely-separated parts, so that the Insect has, on the external
  surface, four eyes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series VI. Rhynchophora</b>.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Head more or less prolonged in front to form a snout or beak, called rostrum.
    Tarsi four-jointed, usually at least the third joint broad and densely pubescent
    beneath.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>This enormous series includes about 25,000 species, and as may well be imagined shows a great
  variety of structure amongst its forms. The vast majority may, however, be readily recognised by
  the two characters mentioned above. There are some cases in which the beak is indistinct, and
  others in which the tarsi are <span class="pagenum" id="page289"><span
  class="smaller">{289}</span></span>five-jointed (<i>Dryophthorus</i>), and even slender
  (Platypides).  In these cases a close examination shows that the gular region on the middle of the
  back of the under surface of the head cannot be detected, and that the back of the prosternum is
  very strongly consolidated by the side-pieces of the thorax meeting together and being very firmly
  joined behind the coxae.  The beak is in the great majority perfectly distinct, though it varies
  so extremely in form that it can only be briefly described by saying that it is a prolongation of
  the head in front of the eyes, or that the antennae are inserted on its sides near to, or far
  from, the tip. It has been ascertained in many cases that the rostrum is used by the female to
  assist in placing the eggs in suitable places, a hole being bored with it; in some cases it is
  also used to push the egg far into the hole in which it has previously been placed by the
  ovipositor; but there are many forms in which it is fairly certain that it is not so used. What
  purpose it serves in the male is totally unknown.  In many members of the series, the rostrum
  differs in form in the two sexes, and in most, if not in all, these cases it is clear that the
  distinctions tend in the direction of making the beak of the female more efficient for the
  mechanical purpose we have mentioned.</p>

  <p>It was proposed by Leconte and Horn to separate this series from all the other Coleoptera as a
  primary division, and they looked on it as of lower or more imperfect structure. Packard has very
  properly protested against this interpretation; and there seems to be no reason whatever for
  considering the Rhynchophora as "lower" than other beetles; indeed we should be inclined to place
  such forms as Calandrides <span class="pagenum" id="page290"><span

  is very sparsely represented in the faunas of Europe and North America. It is quite distinct from
  Curculionidae with which it was formerly associated. It contains many graceful Insects having a
  certain resemblance with Longicorns on account of the large development of the antennae. The
  habits and metamorphoses are but little known. It seems probable that many species find their
  nutriment in old wood or boleti The larvae of some genera (<i>Cratoparis</i> and
  <i>Araeocerus</i>) have legs, but in others the legs are wanting, and the larvae are said to
  completely resemble those of Curculionidae. In the larva of our tiny British species, <i>Choragus
  sheppardi</i>, the legs are replaced by three pairs of thoracic, sac-like pseudopods. This Insect
  makes burrows in dead branches of hawthorn. The larvae of the genus <i>Brachytarsus</i> have been
  ascertained to prey on Coccidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 81. Curculionidae</b> (Weevils).&mdash;<i>The beak of very variable length and
  thickness; the palpi small, nearly always concealed within the mouth, short, and rigid. Labrum
  absent. Antennae of the majority elbowed,</i> i.e. <i>with the basal joint longer, and so formed
  that when it is laterally extended the other joints can be placed in a forward direction.</i> This
  enormous family includes <span class="pagenum" id="page291"><span
  class="smaller">{291}</span></span>about 20,000 known species, and yet a large portion of the
  species yearly brought from the tropics still prove to be new. The rostrum or beak exhibits
  excessive variety in form, and is in many cases different in the sexes; in this case it is usually
  longer and thinner in the female. As the rostrum is one of the chief characters by which a member
  of the family may be recognised, it is necessary to inform the student that in certain forms (the
  Australian Amycterides, <i>e.g.</i>) the organ in question may be so short and thick that it is
  almost absent. In these cases the Insect may be identified as a Curculionid by the gular area
  being absent on the under side of the head, and by the concealment of the palpi. The tarsi are
  usually of the same nature as those of Phytophaga, already described, but the true fourth joint is
  less visible. In the Brachycerides this joint is not present, and the third joint is not lobed.
  The palpi are flexible and more or less exserted in a very few species (Rhynchitides); in
  Rhinomacerides there is also present a minute labrum. The front coxae are deeply embedded, and in
  many forms the prosternum is peculiar in structure; the side-pieces (epimera) meeting at the back
  of the prosternum in the middle line. This, however, is not universal in the family, and it occurs
  in some other beetles (<i>e.g.</i>, Megalopodides of the Phytophaga). The larvae are without legs.
  They are vegetarian, the eggs being deposited by the mother-beetle in the midst of the food. These
  larvae may be distinguished from those of Longicorns by the general form, which is sub-cylindric
  or rather convex, not flattened, and more particularly by the free, exserted head, the mouth being
  directed downwards; the attitude is generally a curve, and the anterior part of the body is a
  little the thicker. No part of plants is exempt from the attacks of the larvae of Curculionidae;
  buds, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruits, bark, pith, roots and galls may each be the special food of
  some Curculionid. Certain species of the sub-families Rhynchitides and Attelabides prepare leaves
  in an elaborate manner to serve as food and dwelling for their young. If young birches, or birch
  bushes from 5 to 10 feet in height, be looked at in the summer, one may often notice that some of
  the leaves are rolled so as to form, each one, a little funnel. This is the work of
  <i>Rhynchites</i> (or <i>Deporaus</i>) <i>betulae</i>, a little Curculionid beetle (Fig. 149). An
  inspection of one of these funnels will show that it is very skilfully constructed.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The whole of a leaf is not used in the formation of a funnel, cuts being made across the leaf
  in suitable directions. The beetle standing on a leaf, as shown in the figure, proceeds to cut
  with its mandibles an incision shaped like an erect <span class="sans fwb">S</span>, commencing at
  a certain part of the circumference, and ending at the midrib of the leaf; the beetle then goes to
  the other side of the midrib, and continues its incision so as to form another <span class="sans
  fwb">S</span>-like curve considerably different from the first; being prostrate and less abrupt.
  Thus the blade of the leaf is divided into two halves by certain curved incisions, the midrib
  remaining intact. The little funnel-twister now commences to roll up the leaf to form the funnel;
  and this part of the work is greatly facilitated by the shape of the incisions. Going back to the
  spot where it commenced work, by the aid of its legs it rolls one side of the leaf round an ideal
  axis, somewhat on the same plan as that adopted by a grocer in forming a paper-funnel for sugar.
  The incisions are found to be just of the right shape to make the overlaps in the rolling, and to
  retain them rolled-up with the least tendency to spring back. After some other operations destined
  to facilitate subsequent parts of its task, the beetle enters the rolled-up part of the leaf and
  brings it more perfectly together; it again comes out and, pursuing a different system, holds on
  with the legs of one side of the body <span class="pagenum" id="page293"><span
  class="smaller">{293}</span></span>to the roll, and with the other legs drags to it the portion of
  the leaf on the other side of the midrib so as to wrap this part (<i>i.e.</i> the result of its
  second incision) round the part of the funnel already constructed. This being done the Insect
  again enters the funnel, bites three or four small cavities on the inside of the leafy wall and
  deposits an egg in each. Afterwards it emerges and fits the overlaps together in a more perfect
  manner so as to somewhat contract the funnel and make it firmer; then proceeding to the tip, this
  is operated on by another series of engineering processes and made to close the orifice; this part
  of the operation being analogous to the closing by the grocer of his paper-funnel after the sugar
  has been put in. The operation of the beetle is, however, much more complex, for it actually makes
  a sort of second small funnel of the tip of the leaf, bends this in, and retains it by tucking in
  some little projections. The work, which has probably lasted about an hour, being now completed,
  the creature takes a longer or shorter rest before commencing another funnel. We have given only a
  sketch of the chief points of the work, omitting reference to smaller artifices of the craft
  master; but we may remark that the curved incisions made by the beetle have been examined by
  mathematicians and duly extolled as being conducted on highly satisfactory mathematical
  principles. It is impossible at present for us to form any conception as to the beetle's
  conceptions in carrying out this complex set of operations. Our perplexity is increased if we
  recollect its life-history, for we then see that neither precept or example can have initiated its
  proceedings, and that imitation is out of the question. The eggs hatch in their dark place, giving
  rise to an eyeless maggot, which ultimately leaves the funnel for the earth. The parts of this
  maggot subsequently undergo complete change to produce the motionless pupa of entirely different
  form, from which emerges the perfect Insect. Hence the beetle cannot be considered to have ever
  seen a funnel, and certainly has never witnessed the construction of one, though, when disclosed,
  it almost immediately sets to work to make funnels on the complex and perfect system we have so
  imperfectly described. More general considerations only add to the perplexity we must feel when
  reflecting on this subject. Why does the Insect construct the funnel at all? As a matter of
  protection it appears to be of little use, for the larvae are known to suffer from the attacks
  <span class="pagenum" id="page294"><span class="smaller">{294}</span></span>of parasites as other
  Insects do. We have not the least reason for supposing that this mode of life for a larva is, so
  far as utility is concerned, better than a more simple and usual one. Indeed, extraordinary as
  this may appear, it is well known that other species of the same genus adopt a simple mode of
  life, laying their eggs in young fruits or buds. We think it possible, however, that a knowledge
  of the mode of feeding of this larva may show that a more perfect nutrition is obtained from a
  well-constructed cylinder, and if so this would to a slight extent satisfy our longing for
  explanation, though throwing no light whatever on the physiology or psychology of the artificer,
  and leaving us hopelessly perplexed as to why a beetle in ages long gone by should or could adopt
  a mode of life that by long processes of evolution should, after enormous difficulties have been
  overcome, attain the perfection we admire.<a id="NtA_153" href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 82. Scolytidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Rostrum extremely short, broad; tibiae frequently
  denticulate externally; antennae short, with a broad club.</i> This family is not at all sharply
  distinguished from certain groups of Curculionidae (from Cossonides <i>e.g.</i>), but as the
  species have somewhat different habits, and in the majority of cases can be readily distinguished,
  it is an advantage to separate the two families. About 1400 species are at present known. Most of
  them are wood- and bark-feeders; some bore into hard wood; a few mine in twigs or small branches
  of trees, but the majority live in the inner layers of the bark; and this also serves as the nidus
  of the larvae. A small number of species have been found to inhabit the stems of herbaceous
  plants, or to live in dry fruits. Owing to their retiring habits they are rarely seen except by
  those who seek them in their abodes, when they may often be found in great profusion. The
  mother-beetle bores into the suitable layer of the bark, forming a sort of tunnel and depositing
  eggs therein. The young larvae start each one a tunnel of its own, diverging from the parent
  tunnel; hence each batch of larvae produces a system of tunnels, starting from the parents'
  burrow, and in many species these burrows are <span class="pagenum" id="page295"><span
  class="smaller">{295}</span></span>characteristic in form and direction, so that the work of
  particular Scolytids can be recognised by the initiated.</p>

  <p>The Platypides bore into the wood of trees and stumps; they are chiefly exotic, and little is
  known about them. They are the most aberrant of all Rhynchophora, the head being remarkably short,
  flat in front, with the mouth placed on the under surface of the head, there being no trace of a
  rostrum: the tarsi are elongate and slender, the third joint not being at all lobed, while the
  true fourth joint is visible. Hence they have not the appearance of Rhynchophora. Some authorities
  treat the Platypides as a distinct family.</p>

  <p>Some of the members of the group Tomicides also bore into the wood. Recent observations have
  shown that there is an important feature in the economy of certain of these wood-borers, inasmuch
  as they live gregariously in the burrow, and feed on peculiar fungi that develop there, and are
  called ambrosia. According to Hubbard<a id="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a>, some
  species cultivate these fungi, making elaborate preparations to start their growth. The fungi,
  however, sometimes increase to such an extent as to seal up the burrows, and kill the Insects by
  suffocation.</p>

  <p>Scolytidae sometimes multiply to an enormous extent, attacking and destroying the trees in
  wooded regions. Much discussion has taken place as to whether or not they are really injurious. It
  is contended by one set of partisans that they attack only timber that is in an unhealthy, dying,
  or dead condition. It may be admitted that this is usually the case; yet when they occur in
  enormous numbers they may attack timber that is in a sort of neutral state of health, and so
  diminish its vigour, and finally cause its destruction. Hence it is of great importance that they
  should be watched by competent foresters.</p>

  <p>The larvae of Scolytidae are said to completely resemble those of Curculionidae: except in the
  group Platypides, where the body is straight and almost cylindrical, and terminates in an oblique
  truncation bearing a short hard spine.<a id="NtA_155" href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 83. Brenthidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Form elongate; rostrum straight, directly continuing the
  long axis of the body, often so thick as to form an elongate head; antennae not elbowed.</i> The
  Brenthidae form a family of about 800 species, remarkable for the excessive <span class="pagenum"
  id="page296"><span class="smaller">{296}</span></span>length and slenderness of some of its forms,
  and for the extreme difference in the sexes that frequently exists. It is well represented in the
  tropics only, and very little is known as to the natural history and development. These beetles
  are stated to be wood-feeders, and no doubt this is correct in the case of the majority of the
  species; but Mr. Lewis observed in Japan that <i>Zemioses celtis</i> and <i>Cyphagogus
  segnipes</i> are predaceous, and enter the burrows of wood-boring Insects to search for larvae as
  prey: they are very much modified in structure to permit this; and as the other members of the
  group Taphroderides are similar in structure, it is probable that they are all predaceous. Nothing
  whatever is known as to the larval history of these carnivorous forms. Indeed an uncertainty,
  almost complete, prevails as to the early stages of this family. Riley has given a sketch of a
  larva which he had no doubt was that of <i>Eupsalis minuta</i>, the North American representative
  of the family; if he is correct the larva differs from those of Curculionidae by its elongate
  form, and by the possession of thoracic legs: these, though small, are three-jointed.
  Descriptions, supposed to be those of Brenthid larvae, were formerly published by Harris and
  Motschoulsky; but it is now clear that both were mistaken.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the higher forms of Brenthidae the rostrum of the female is perfectly cylindrical and
  polished, and the mandibles are minute, hard, pointed processes placed at its tip. This organ is
  admirably adapted to its purpose; it being used for boring a hole in wood or bark, in which an egg
  is subsequently deposited. The males in these cases are extremely different, so that considerable
  curiosity is felt as to why this should be so. In some cases their head is thick, and there may be
  no rostrum, while large powerful mandibles are present.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In other cases the rostrum is slender, but of enormous length, so that it may
  surpass in this respect the rest of <span class="pagenum" id="page297"><span
  class="smaller">{297}</span></span>the body, although this itself is so drawn out as to be quite
  exceptional in the Insect world:<a id="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> the antennae
  are inserted near the tip of the rostrum instead of near its base, as they are in the female. The
  size of the males is in these cases usually much larger than that of the female.<a id="NtA_157"
  href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> The males of some species fight; they do not, however, wound
  their opponent, but merely frighten him away. In <i>Eupsalis</i> it appears that the rostrum of
  the female is apt to become fixed in the wood during her boring operations; and the male then
  extricates her by pressing his heavy prosternum against the tip of her abdomen; the stout forelegs
  of the female serve as a fulcrum and her long body as a lever, so that the effort of the male,
  exerted at one extremity of the body of the female, produces the required result at the other end
  of her body. The New Zealand Brenthid, <i>Lasiorhynchus barbicornis</i>, exhibits sexual disparity
  in an extreme degree: the length of the male is usually nearly twice that of the female, and his
  rostrum is enormous. It is at present impossible to assign any reason for this; observations made
  at the request of the writer by Mr. Helms some years ago, elicited the information that the female
  is indefatigable in her boring efforts, and that the huge male stands near by as a witness,
  apparently of the most apathetic kind.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 84. Aglycyderidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi three-jointed, the second joint lobed; head not

  Insects, while the other structural characters are very imperfectly known, many parts of the
  external skeleton being so completely fused that the details of structure are difficult of

  class="pagenum" id="page298"><span class="smaller">{298}</span></span>at all clear that the minute
  knot he considered the third joint is more than the articulation of the elongate terminal joint.
  The family consists only of two or three species of <i>Aglycyderes</i>, one of which occurs in the
  Canary Islands, and one or two in New Zealand and New Caledonia. The former is believed to live in
  the stems of <i>Euphorbia canariensis</i>; a New Zealand species has been found in connection with

  <p>These curious Insects are parasitic in the interior of other Insects, of the Orders Hymenoptera
  and Hemiptera. Their structure and their life-histories entitle them to be ranked as the most
  abnormal of all Insects, and entomologists are not agreed as to whether they are aberrant
  Coleoptera or a distinct Order. The newly-hatched larva is a minute triungulin (Fig. 154),
  somewhat like that of <i>Meloe</i>; it fixes itself to the skin of the larva of a Hymenopterous
  Insect, penetrates into the interior, and there undergoes its metamorphoses, the male emerging to
  enjoy a brief period of an abnormally active, indeed agitated, existence, while the female never
  moves. It is important to note that these Strepsiptera do not, like most other internal parasites,
  produce the death of their hosts; these complete their metamorphosis, and the development of the
  parasite goes on simultaneously with that of the host, so that the imago of the Strepsipteron is
  found only in the imago of the host.<a id="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> After the
  young <i>Stylops</i> has entered its host it feeds for a week or so on the fat-body (apparently by
  a process of suction), then moults and assumes the condition of a footless maggot, in which state
  it remains till growth is completed. At the latter part of this period the history diverges
  according to sex; the female undergoes only a slight metamorphic development of certain parts,
  accompanied apparently by actual degradation of other parts; while the male goes on to pupation,
  as is normal in Insects. (We may remark that the great features of the development of the sexes
  are parallel with those of Coccidae in Hemiptera.) When the Hymenopterous larva changes to a pupa,
  the larva of the Strepsipteron pushes one extremity of its body between two of the abdominal rings
  of its host, so that this extremity becomes external, and in this position it completes its
  metamorphosis, the <span class="pagenum" id="page300"><span
  class="smaller">{300}</span></span>male emerging very soon after the host has become an active
  winged Insect, while the female undergoes no further change of position, but becomes a sac, in the
  interior of which young develop in enormous numbers, finally emerging from the mother-sac in the
  form of the little triungulins we have already mentioned. This is all that can be given at present
  as a general account; many points of the natural history are still obscure, others have been
  merely guessed; while some appear to differ greatly in the different forms. A few brief remarks as
  to these points must suffice.</p>

  <p>Bees carrying, or that have carried, Strepsiptera, are said to be stylopised (it being a
  species of the genus <i>Stylops</i> that chiefly infests bees); the term is also used with a wider
  application, all Insects that carry a Strepsipterous parasite being termed stylopised, though it
  may be a Strepsipteron of a genus very different from <i>Stylops</i> that attacks them. The
  development of one or more Strepsiptera in an Insect usually causes some deformity in the abdomen
  of its host, and effects considerable changes in the condition of its internal organs, and also in
  some of the external characters. Great difference of opinion prevails as to what these changes
  are; it is clear, however, that they vary much according to the species, and also according to the
  extent of the stylopisation. Usually only one <i>Stylops</i> is developed in a bee; but two,
  three, and even four have been observed:<a id="NtA_159" href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> and in
  the case of the wasp, <i>Polistes</i>, Hubbard has observed that a single individual may bear
  eight or ten individuals of its Strepsipteron (<i>Xenos</i>, n. sp.?).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is no exact information as to how the young triungulins find their way to the bee-larvae
  they live in. Here again the discrepancy of opinion that prevails is probably due to great <span
  class="pagenum" id="page301"><span class="smaller">{301}</span></span>difference really existing
  as to the method. When a <i>Stylops</i> carried by an Insect (a Hymenopteron, be it noted, for we
  have no information whatever as to Hemiptera) produces young, they cover the body of the host as
  if it were powdered, being excessively minute and their numbers very great; many hundreds, if not
  thousands, of young being produced by a single <i>Stylops</i>. The species of the wasp genus
  <i>Polistes</i> are specially subject to the attacks of <i>Stylops</i>; they are social Insects,
  and a stylopised specimen being sickly does not as a rule leave the nest; in this case the
  <i>Stylops</i> larva may therefore have but little difficulty in finding its way to a
  Hymenopterous larva, for even though it may have to live for months before it has the chance of
  attaching itself to a nest-building female, yet it is clearly in the right neighbourhood. The bee
  genus <i>Andrena</i> has, however, quite different habits; normally a single female makes her nest
  underground; but in the case of a stylopised female it is certain that no nest is built, and no
  larvae produced by a stylopised example, so that the young triungulins must leave the body of the
  bee in order to come near their prey. They can be active, and have great powers of leaping, so
  that it is perhaps in this way possible for them to attach themselves to a healthy female bee.</p>

  <p>We have still only very imperfect knowledge as to the structure and development of
  Strepsiptera. Indeed but little information has been obtained since 1843.<a id="NtA_160"
  href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> Before that time the mature female was supposed to be a larva,
  and the triungulins found in it to be parasites. Although the erroneous character of these views
  has been made clear, the problems that have been suggested present great difficulties. Apparently
  the change from the triungulin condition (Fig. 154) to the parasitic larvae (Fig. 155, A, B) is
  extremely great and abrupt, and it appears also that during <span class="pagenum"
  id="page302"><span class="smaller">{302}</span></span>the larval growth considerable sexual
  differentiation occurs (Fig. 155, C, D); details are, however, wanting, and there exists but
  little information as to the later stages. Hence it is scarcely a matter for surprise that
  authorities differ as to which is the head and which the anal extremity of the adult female. Von
  Siebold apparently entertained no doubt as to the part of the female that is extruded being the
  anterior extremity; indeed he called it a cephalothorax. Supposing this view to be correct, we are
  met by the extraordinary facts that the female extrudes the head for copulatory purposes, that the
  genital orifice is placed thereon, and that the young escape by it. Meinert<a id="NtA_161"
  href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> contends that the so-called cephalothorax of the adult is the
  anal extremity, and that fertilisation and the escape of the young are effected by the natural
  passages, the anterior parts of the body being affected by a complete degeneration. Nassonoff, in
  controversion of Meinert, has recently pointed out that the "cephalothorax" of the young is shown
  by the nervous system to be the anterior extremity. It still remains, however, to be shewn that
  the "cephalothorax" of the adult female corresponds with that of the young, and we shall not be
  surprised if Meinert prove to be correct. The internal anatomy and the processes of oogenesis
  appear to be of a very unusual character, but their details are far from clear. Brandt has given
  some particulars as to the nervous system; though he does not say whether taken from the male or
  female, we may presume it to be from the former; there is a supra-oesophageal ganglion, and near
  it a large mass which consists of two parts, the anterior representing the sub-oesophageal and the
  first thoracic ganglia, while the posterior represents two of the thoracic and most of the
  abdominal ganglia of other Insects; at the posterior extremity, connected with the other ganglia
  by a very long and slender commissure, there is another abdominal ganglion.<a id="NtA_162"
  href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is a matter of great difficulty to procure material for the prosecution of this study; the
  fact that the instars to be observed exist only in the interior of a few Hymenopterous larvae,
  which in the case of the bee, <i>Andrena</i>, are concealed under ground; and in the case of the
  wasps, <i>Polistes</i>, placed in cells in a nest of wasps, adds greatly to the difficulty. It is
  therefore of interest to know that Strepsiptera occur in Insects with incomplete <span
  class="pagenum" id="page303"><span class="smaller">{303}</span></span>metamorphosis. They have
  been observed in several species of Homoptera; and the writer has a large Pentatomid bug of the
  genus <i>Callidea</i>, which bears a female Strepsipteron apparently of large size. This bug<a
  id="NtA_163" href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> is abundant and widely distributed in Eastern
  Asia, and it may prove comparatively easy to keep stylopised examples under observation. Both v.
  Siebold and Nassonoff think parthenogenesis occurs in Strepsiptera, but there appear to be no
  facts to warrant this supposition. Von Siebold speaks of the phenomena of Strepsipterous
  reproduction as paedogenesis, or pseudo-paedogenesis, but we must agree with Meinert that they
  cannot be so classed.</p>

  <p>The males of Strepsiptera live for only a very short time, and are very difficult of
  observation. According to Hubbard the males of <i>Xenos</i> dash about so rapidly that the eye
  cannot see them, and they create great agitation amongst the wasps in the colonies of which they
  are bred. Apparently they are produced in great numbers, and their life consists of only fifteen
  or twenty minutes of fiery energy. The males of <i>Stylops</i> are not exposed to such dangers as
  those of <i>Xenos</i>, and apparently live somewhat longer&mdash;a day or two, and even three days
  are on record. The individuals of <i>Andrena</i> parasitised by <i>Stylops</i> are apparently
  greatly affected in their economy and appear earlier in the season than other individuals; this
  perhaps may be a reason, coupled with their short lives, for their being comparatively rarely met
  with by entomologists.</p>

  <p>Lepidoptera, or butterflies and moths, are so far as ornament is concerned the highest of the
  Insect world. In respect of intelligence the Order is inferior to the Hymenoptera, in the
  mechanical adaptation of the parts of the body it is inferior to Coleoptera, and in perfection of
  metamorphosis it is second to Diptera. The mouth of Lepidoptera is quite peculiar; the
  proboscis&mdash;the part of the apparatus for the prehension of food&mdash;is anatomically very
  different from the proboscis of the other Insects that suck, and finds its nearest analogue in the
  extreme elongation of the maxillae of certain Coleoptera, e.g. <i>Nemognatha</i>. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page305"><span class="smaller">{305}</span></span>The female has no
  gonapophyses, though in certain exceptional forms of Tineidae, there are modifications of
  structure connected with the terminal segments, that have as yet been only imperfectly
  investigated. As a rule, the egg is simply deposited on some living vegetable and fastened
  thereto. Lepidoptera are the most exclusively vegetarian of all the Orders of Insects; a certain
  number of their larvae prey on Insects that are themselves filled with vegetable juices (Coccidae,
  Aphidae) and a very small number (<i>Tinea</i>, etc.) eat animal matter. In general the nutriment
  appears to be drawn exclusively from the fluids of the vegetables, the solid matter passing from
  the alimentary canal in large quantity in the form of little pellets usually dry, and called
  frass. Hence the quantity of food ingested is large, and when the individuals unduly increase in
  number, forest trees over large areas are sometimes completely defoliated by the caterpillars.</p>

  <p>Lepidoptera pass a larger portion of their lives in the pupal stage than most other Insects do;
  frequently during nine months of the year the Lepidopteron may be a pupa. In other Orders of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page306"><span class="smaller">{306}</span></span>Insects it would appear that
  the tendency of the higher forms is to shorten the pupal period, and when much time has to be
  passed between the end of the feeding up of the larva and the appearance of the imago, to pass
  this time as much as possible in the form of a resting-larva, and as little as may be in the form
  of a pupa; in Lepidoptera the reverse is the case; the resting-larva period being usually reduced
  to a day or two. Hence we can understand the importance of a hard skin to the pupa. There are,
  however, numerous Lepidopterous pupae where the skin does not attain the condition of hardness
  that is secured for the higher forms by the chitinous exudation we have mentioned; and there are
  also cases where there is a prolonged resting-larva period: for instance <i>Galleria
  mellonella</i> spins a cocoon in the autumn and remains in it as a resting larva all the winter,
  becoming a pupa only in the spring. In many of these cases the resting-larva is protected by a
  cocoon. It is probable that the chief advantage of the perfect chitinous exudation of the
  Lepidopterous pupa is to prevent the tiny, complex organisation from the effects of undue
  transpiration. Bataillon has suggested that the relation of the fluid contents of the pupa to air
  and moisture are of great importance in the physiology of metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>The duration of life is very different in various forms of Lepidoptera. It is known that
  certain species (<i>Ephestia kuehniella</i>, <i>e.g.</i>) may go through at least five generations
  a year. On the other hand, certain species that feed on wood or roots may take three years to
  complete their life-history; and it is probable that some of the forms of Hepialidae are even
  longer lived than this.</p>

  <p>Lepidoptera have always been a favourite Order with entomologists, but no good list of the
  species has ever been made, and it would be a difficult matter to say how many species are at
  present known, but it can scarcely be less than 50,000. In Britain we have about 2000 species.</p>

  <p>The close affinity of the Order with Trichoptera has long been recognised: R&eacute;aumur considered
  the latter to be practically Lepidoptera with aquatic habits, and Speyer pointed out the existence
  of very numerous points of similarity between the two. Brauer emphasised the existence of
  mandibles in the nymph of Trichoptera as an important distinction: the pupa <span class="pagenum"
  id="page307"><span class="smaller">{307}</span></span>of <i>Micropteryx</i> (Fig. 211) has however
  been recently shown to be similar to that of Trichoptera, so that unless it should be decided to
  transfer <i>Micropteryx</i> to Trichoptera, and then define Lepidoptera and Trichoptera as
  distinguished by the condition of the pupa, it would appear to be very difficult to retain the two
  groups as distinct.</p>

  <p><b>Structure of Imago.</b>&mdash;The head of a Lepidopteron is in large part made up of the
  compound eyes; in addition to these it frequently bears at the top a pair of small, simple eyes so
  much concealed by the scales as to cause us to wonder if seeing be carried on by them. The larger
  part of the front of the head is formed by the clypeus, which is separated by a well-marked line
  from the epicranium, the antennae being inserted on the latter near its point of junction with the
  former. There is sometimes (<i>Saturnia</i>, <i>Castnia</i>) on each side of the clypeus a deep
  pocket projecting into the head-cavity. The other parts of the head are but small. The occipital
  foramen is very large.<a id="NtA_164" href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

  numerous segments, and in the males of many species attain a very complex structure, especially in
  Bombyces and Psychidae; they doubtless function in such cases as sense-organs for the discovery of
  the female.</p>

  <p>The largest and most important of the mouth-parts are the maxillae and the labial palpi, the
  other parts being so small as to render their detection difficult. The labrum is a very short,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page308"><span class="smaller">{308}</span></span>comparatively broad
  piece, visible on the front edge of the clypeus; its lateral part usually forms a prominence which
  has often been mistaken for a mandible; Kellogg has applied the term "pilifer" to this part. In
  the middle of the labrum a small angular or tongue-like projection is seen just over the middle of
  the base of the proboscis; this little piece is considered by several authorities to be an
  epipharynx.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mandibles</span>.&mdash;Savigny, Westwood, and others considered the parts of
  the labrum recently designated pilifers by Kellogg to be the rudimentary mandibles, but Walter has
  shown that this is not the case.<a id="NtA_165" href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> The mandibles
  are usually indistinguishable, though they, or some prominence possibly connected with them,<a
  id="NtA_166" href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> may frequently be detected in the neighbourhood
  of the pilifers; they are, according to Walter, largest and most perfectly developed in
  <i>Eriocephala</i>, a genus that was not distinguished by him from <i>Micropteryx</i> and was
  therefore termed "niedere Micropteryginen," <i>i.e.</i> lower Micropteryges. The opinion
  entertained by Walter that <i>Micropteryx</i> proper (his "h&ouml;here Micropteryginen") also possesses
  rudimentary mandibles is considered by Dr. Chapman, no doubt with reason, to be erroneous.<a
  id="NtA_167" href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> The mandibles, however, in the vast majority of
  Lepidoptera can scarcely be said to exist at all in the imago; there being only an obtuse
  projection&mdash;without trace of <span class="pagenum" id="page309"><span
  class="smaller">{309}</span></span>articulation&mdash;on each side of the labrum; and even this
  projection is usually absent. Meinert recognised these projections as mandibles in <i>Smerinthus
  populi</i>, and Kellogg in <i>Protoparce carolina</i>, another large Sphinx moth. They appear to
  be unusually well developed in that group. In <i>Castnia</i> they are even more definite than they
  are in Sphingidae.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Maxillae</span> are chiefly devoted to the formation of the proboscis.
  Their basal portions are anatomically very indefinite, though they exist very intimately connected
  with the labium. Each usually bears a small tubercle or a segmented process, the representative of
  the maxillary palpus. The proboscis itself consists of the terminal, or outer, parts of the two
  maxillae, which parts are closely and beautifully coadapted to form the spirally coiled organ,
  that is sometimes, though incorrectly, called the tongue. The exact morphology of the
  Lepidopterous proboscis has not been established. The condition existing in the curious family
  Prodoxidae (see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page432">432</a></span>), where a proboscis
  coexists with another structure called a maxillary tentacle, suggests a correspondence between the
  latter and the galea of a typical maxilla; and between the proboscis and the lacinia or inner lobe
  of a maxilla: but J. B. Smith is of opinion that the tentacle in question is a prolongation of the
  stipes. The condition of the parts in this anomalous family (Prodoxidae) has not, however, been
  thoroughly investigated, and Packard takes a different view of the proboscis; he considers that
  "it is the two galeae which become elongated, united and highly specialised to form the so-called
  tongue or glossa of all Lepidoptera above the Eriocephalidae."<a id="NtA_168"
  href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> The proboscis in some cases becomes very remarkable, and in
  certain Sphingidae is said to attain, when unrolled, a length of ten inches. In some cases the
  maxillary lobes do not form a proboscis, but exist as delicate structures, pendulous from the
  mouth, without coadaptation (<i>Zeuzera aesculi</i>, the Wood-leopard moth). In other forms they
  are absent altogether (<i>Cossus</i>, <i>e.g.</i>), and in <i>Hepialus</i> we have failed to
  detect any evidence of the existence of the maxillae. On the other hand, in <i>Micropteryx</i> the
  maxillae are much more like those of a mandibulate Insect; and various other Microlepidoptera
  approach more or less a similar condition. In the genus last mentioned <span class="pagenum"
  id="page310"><span class="smaller">{310}</span></span>the maxillary palpi are largely developed,
  flexible and slender. According to Walter various forms of palpus intermediate between that of
  <i>Micropteryx</i> and the condition of rudimentary tubercle may be found amongst the
  Microlepidoptera.<a id="NtA_169" href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Labium</span>.&mdash;The labial palpi are usually largely developed, though
  but little flexible; they form conspicuous processes densely covered with scales or hairs, and
  curve forwards or upwards, rarely downwards, from the under side of the head, somewhat in the
  fashion of tusks. The other parts of the labium are frequently represented merely by a membranous
  structure, united with the maxillae and obstructing the cavity of the pharynx. Where the proboscis
  is absent it is difficult to find any orifice leading to the alimentary canal, such opening as may
  exist being concealed by the overhanging clypeus and labium. In some forms, <i>Saturnia</i>,
  <i>e.g.</i>, there appears to be no buccal orifice whatever. In <i>Hepialus</i> the labium is in a
  very unusual condition; it projects externally in the position usually occupied by the labial
  palpi, these organs being themselves extremely short. It is very difficult to form an opinion as
  to the structure of the labium and other mouth-parts when the maxillae are not developed, as in
  these cases the parts are of a delicate membranous nature, and shrivel after death. This is the
  explanation of the fact that in descriptive works we find vague terms in use such as "mouth
  aborted" or "tongue absent."</p>

  <p>The mouth of the Lepidopterous imago is a paradoxical structure; it differs very greatly from
  that of the larva, the changes during metamorphosis being extreme. We should thus be led to infer
  that it is of great importance to the creatures; but, on the other hand, the various structures
  that make up the mouth, as we have remarked, are frequently absent or reduced to insignificant
  proportions; and even in forms where the apparatus is highly developed the individuals seem to be
  able to accomplish oviposition without taking food, or after taking only very minute quantities.
  It is therefore difficult to understand why so great a change should occur during the
  metamorphosis of the Insects of this Order. It has been ascertained that in some forms where the
  mouth is atrophied the stomach is in a correlative condition; but we are not aware that any
  investigations have been made as to whether this correspondence is general or exceptional.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page311"><span class="smaller">{311}</span></span></div>

  <p>The exact mode in which the proboscis acts is in several respects still obscure, the views of
  Burmeister and Newport being in some points erroneous. Towards the tip of the proboscis there are
  some minute but complex structures considered by Fritz M&uuml;ller to be sense-organs, and by
  Breitenbach to be mechanical instruments for irritating or lacerating the delicate tissues of
  blossoms. It is probable that M&uuml;ller's view will prove to be correct. Nevertheless the proboscis
  has considerable power of penetration; there being a moth, "<i>Ophideres fullonica</i>" that
  causes considerable damage to crops of oranges by inserting its trunk through the peel so as to
  suck the juices.<a id="NtA_170" href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> The canal formed by each
  maxilla opens into a cavity inside the front part of the head. This cavity, according to
  Burgess,<a id="NtA_171" href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> is a sort of sac connected with five
  muscles, and by the aid of this apparatus the act of suction is performed: the diverticulum of the
  alimentary canal, usually called a sucking-stomach, not really possessing the function formerly
  attributed to it.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Prothorax</span> is very small, being reduced to a collar, between the
  head and the alitrunk, of just sufficient size to bear the front pair of legs. Its most remarkable
  feature is a pair of processes, frequently existing on the upper surface, called "patagia." These
  in many cases (especially in Noctuidae) are lobes capable of considerable movement, being attached
  only by a narrow base. In <i>Hepialus</i>, on the contrary, they are not free, but are merely
  indicated by curved marks on the dorsum. The patagia are styled by many writers "tegulae." They
  are of some interest in connection with the question of wing-like appendages on the prothorax of
  Palaeozoic insects, and they have been considered by some writers<a id="NtA_172"
  href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> to be the equivalents of true wings. The Mesothorax is very
  large, especially its upper face, the notum, which is more or less convex, and in the higher forms
  attains a great extension from before backwards. The notum consists in greater part of a large
  anterior piece, the meso-scutum, and a <span class="pagenum" id="page312"><span
  class="smaller">{312}</span></span>smaller part, the meso-scutellum behind. In front of the scutum
  there is a piece termed prae-scutum by Burgess. It is usually small and concealed by the front
  part of the scutum; but in <i>Hepialus</i> it is large and horizontal in position. It is of
  importance as being the chief point of articulation with the prothorax. The scutellum is more or
  less irregularly rhomboidal in form; its hinder margin usually looks as if it were a lobe or fold
  placed in front of the base of the abdomen or metathorax, according to whether the latter is
  concealed or visible. In some of the higher forms this meso-scutellar lobe is prominent, and there
  may be seen under its projection a piece that has been called the post-scutellum, and is really
  the base of the great mesophragma, a chitinous piece that descends far down into the interior of
  the body. In addition to the front pair of wings the mesothorax bears on its upper surface another
  pair of appendages, the tegulae: in the higher forms they are of large size; they are fastened on
  the front of the mesothorax, and extend backwards over the joint of the wing with the body, being
  densely covered with scales so that they are but little conspicuous. These appendages are
  frequently erroneously called patagia, but have also been called scapulae, pterygodes, paraptera,
  and shoulder-tufts, or shoulder-lappets. The lower surface of the mesothorax is much concealed by
  the large and prominent coxae, but the sternum and the two pleural pieces on each side, episternum
  and epimeron, are easily detected. The area for attachment of the anterior wing on each side is
  considerable, and appears to be of rather complex structure; its anatomy has been, however, but
  little studied.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Metathorax</span> is small in comparison with the preceding segment, to
  which it is intimately co-adapted, though the two are really connected only by delicate membrane,
  and can consequently be separated with ease by dissection. The metanotum consists of (1) the
  scutum, which usually appears externally as an anterior piece on each side; (2) the scutellum,
  forming a median piece placed behind the scutum, which it tends to separate into two parts by its
  own extension forwards. In order to understand the structure of the metathorax it is desirable to
  dissect it off from the larger anterior segment, and it will then be found that its appearance
  when undissected is deceptive, owing to its being greatly arched, or folded in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page313"><span class="smaller">{313}</span></span>antero-posterior direction.
  A broad, but short phragma descends from the hind margin of the metascutellum into the interior of
  the body. It should be noted that though the metanotum is forced, as it were, backwards by the
  great extension of the mesonotum in the middle line of the body, yet at the sides the metanotum
  creeps forward so as to keep the points of attachment of the hind wings near to those of the front
  wings. In many forms of Hesperiidae, Sphingidae, Noctuidae, etc. the true structure of the
  metanotum is further concealed by the back of the mesoscutellum reposing on, and covering it.</p>

  <p>Difference of opinion exists as to the thoracic Spiracles; there is one conspicuous enough in
  the membrane behind the pronotum, and it is thought by some writers that no other exists. Westwood
  and Scudder, however, speak of a mesothoracic spiracle, and Dr. Chapman considers that one exists.
  Minot describes<a id="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> a structure behind the anterior
  wing, and thinks it may be an imperfect spiracle, and we have found a similar stigma in
  <i>Saturnia pavonia</i>. At the back of the thorax there is on each side in some Lepidoptera
  (Noctuidae, <i>Arctia</i>, etc.), a curious large cavity formed by a projection backwards from the
  sides of the metasternum, and a corresponding development of the pleura of the first abdominal
  segment. Minot and others have suggested that this may be an organ of hearing.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Abdomen</span> differs according to the sex. In the female seven segments
  are conspicuous dorsally, but only six ventrally, because the first segment is entirely membranous
  beneath, and is concealed between the second abdominal ventral plate and the posterior coxae.
  Besides these segments there are at the hind end two others smaller, more or less completely
  withdrawn into the body, and in certain cases forming an ovipositor. These nine segments are
  usually considered to constitute the abdomen; but according to Peytoureau,<a id="NtA_174"
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> a tenth dorsal plate is represented on either side of the anal
  orifice, though there is no trace of a corresponding ventral plate. In the male the segments,
  externally conspicuous, are one more than in the female. According to the authority quoted,<a
  id="NtA_175" href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> this sex has also truly ten abdominal segments,
  the ninth segment being withdrawn to a greater or <span class="pagenum" id="page314"><span
  class="smaller">{314}</span></span>less extent to the inside of the body, and modified to form
  part of a copulatory apparatus; its dorsal portion bears a process called the "uncus"; the anal
  orifice opens on the inner face of this process, and below it there is another
  process&mdash;developed to a greater or less extent&mdash;called the "scaphium." The ventral
  portion of the ninth segment bears a lobe, the "saccus" (Peytoureau, <i>l.c.</i>). On each side of
  the ninth abdominal segment there is a process called the "valve," the internal wall of which
  bears some hook-like or other processes called "harpes"; it is continued as a membrane surrounding
  the "oedeagus," or penis, and&mdash;bearing more or less distinct prominences&mdash;connects with
  the scaphium. In many forms the parts alluded to, other than the valves, are concealed by the
  latter, which come together when closed, and may be covered externally with scales like the rest
  of the abdomen. Peytoureau considers that the uncus is really the dorsal plate of a tenth segment,
  and that the scaphium is the tenth ventral plate. Thus, according to this view, the ninth segment
  is extensive and complex, being very highly modified in all its parts: while the tenth segment is
  greatly reduced. The structure of the male organs is simpler in Lepidoptera, and less varied than
  it is in the other great Orders of Insects. There are seven pairs of abdominal spiracles on the
  upper parts of the membranous pleurae.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Legs</span>.&mdash;The legs are long, slender, covered with scales, and
  chiefly remarkable from the fact that the tibiae sometimes bear articulated spurs on their middle
  as well as at the tip. The front tibia usually possesses on its inner aspect a peculiar mobile
  pad; this seems to be in some cases a combing organ; it also often acts as a cover to peculiar
  scales. The tarsi are five-jointed, with two small claws and a small apparatus, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page315"><span class="smaller">{315}</span></span>the functional importance of
  which is unknown, between the claws.</p>

  <p><b>Wings.</b>&mdash;The wings are the most remarkable feature of this Order; it is to them that
  butterflies owe their beauty, the surfaces of the wings being frequently adorned with colours and
  patterns of the most charming and effective nature. These effects are due to minute scales that
  are implanted in the wing-membrane in an overlapping manner, somewhat similar to the arrangement
  of slates on the roof of a house. The scales are very readily displaced, and have the appearance
  of a silky dust. We shall describe their structure and allude to their development subsequently.
  The wings are usually of large size in comparison with the Insect's body: in the genus
  <i>Morpho</i>, the most gorgeous of the butterflies, they are enormous, though the body is small;
  so that when deprived of these floats the Insect is insignificant. The great expanse of wing is
  not correlative with great powers of flight, though it is perhaps indicative of flying with little
  exertion; for the small-winged Lepidoptera, Sphingidae, etc., have much greater powers of a&euml;rial
  evolution than the large-winged forms. The area of the wing is increased somewhat by the fact that
  the scales on the outer margin, and on a part or on the whole of the inner margin, project beyond
  the edges of the membrane that bears them: these projecting marginal scales are called fringes. In
  many of the very small moths the actual size of the wing-membranes is much reduced, but in such
  cases the fringes may be very long, so as to form the larger part of the surface, especially of
  that of the hind wings. Frequently the hind wings are of remarkable shape, being prolonged into
  processes or tails, some of which are almost as remarkable as those of <i>Nemoptera</i> in the
  Order Neuroptera.</p>

  <p>The wings are very rarely absent in Lepidoptera; this occurs only in the female sex, no male
  Lepidopterous imago destitute of wings having been discovered. Although but little is known of the
  physiology of flight of Lepidoptera, yet it is clearly important that the two wings of the same
  side should be perfectly coadapted or correlated. This is effected largely by the front wing
  overlapping the hind one to a considerable extent, and by the two contiguous surfaces being
  pressed, as it were, together. This is the system found in butterflies and in some of the large
  moths, such as Lasiocampidae and Saturniidae; in these cases the hind <span class="pagenum"
  id="page316"><span class="smaller">{316}</span></span>wing always has a large shoulder, or area,
  anterior to its point of insertion. In most moths this shoulder is absent, but in its place there
  are one or more stiff bristles projecting forwards and outwards, and passing under a little
  membranous flap, or a tuft of thick scales on the under face of the front wing; the bristle is
  called the "frenulum," the structure that retains it a "retinaculum." In <i>Castnia</i> (Fig. 162)
  and in some Sphingidae there is the unusual condition of a highly-developed shoulder (<i>s</i>)
  coexisting with a perfect frenulum (<i>f</i>) and retinaculum (<i>r</i>). The frenulum and
  retinaculum usually differ in structure, and the retinaculum in position, in the two sexes of the
  same moth; the male, which in moths has superior powers of flight, having the better retaining
  organs. Hampson says "the form of the frenulum is of great use in determining sex, as in the males
  of all the forms that possess it, it consists of hairs firmly soldered together so as to form a
  single bristle, whilst in nearly all females it consists of three or more bristles which are
  shorter than that of the male; in one female Cossid I have found as many as nine. Also in the
  large majority of moths the retinaculum descends from the costal nervure in the male, while in the
  female it ascends from the median nervure."<a id="NtA_176" href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a>
  This sexual difference in a structure for the discharge of a function common to the two sexes is a
  very remarkable fact. There are a few&mdash;very few&mdash;moths in which the bases of the hind
  wings are not well coadapted with the front wings, and do not possess a frenulum, and these
  species possess a small more or less free lobe at the base of the front wing that droops towards
  the hind wing, and may thus help to keep up an imperfect connexion between the pair; this lobe has
  been named a jugum by Professor Comstock. Occasionally there is a jugum on the hind as well as on
  the front wing. There is usually a very great difference between the front and the hind wings; for
  whereas in the front wing the anterior portion is doubtless of great importance in the act of
  flight and is provided with numerous veins, in the hind wing, on the other hand, the corresponding
  part has not a similar function, being covered by the front wing; hence the hind wing is provided
  with fewer nervures in the anterior region, the divisions of the subcostal being less numerous
  than they are in the front wing. In the moths possessing a jugum the two wings differ but little
  from one <span class="pagenum" id="page317"><span class="smaller">{317}</span></span>another, and
  it is probable that they function almost as four separate wings instead of as two pairs.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Wing-nervures</span>.&mdash;The nervures or ribs of the wings are of great
  importance in Lepidoptera, as at present they furnish the chief characters for classification and
  for the discussions of phylogeny that are so numerous in entomological literature. On looking at
  wings that have been deprived of their scales it will be noticed (Fig. 161) that the ribs are much
  more numerous at the outer margins than they are near the points of attachment of the wings, and
  that there is usually but one cell (or area completely enclosed by ribs). This latter point is one
  of the chief peculiarities of the Lepidopterous wing; in Insect-wings generally the number of
  cells in proportion to the area of the wings and to the number of nervures is greater than it is
  in Lepidoptera, for in the latter there are few or no cross-nervures. Hence there is sometimes no
  closed cell at all on the wing (Fig. 161, II. B). The maximum number of closed cells is six; this
  is found in some species of <i>Micropteryx</i>, while in <i>Hepialus</i> there may be three or
  four; but the rule is that there is only one cell in the Lepidopterous wing. When the number of
  cells is increased this is not necessarily due to an increase in the cross-nervures; and in fact
  it is generally due to irregular forking or to the sinuous form of the longitudinal nervures
  themselves (see wing of <i>Castnia</i>, Fig. 162, A.). Some authorities consider that all
  transverse or cross-veins in Lepidoptera are merely portions of longitudinal veins having diverted
  courses. When a portion of a nervure beyond the basal or primary portion serves as a common piece
  to two forked parts external to it, it is called a stalk (Fig. 162, A, <i>e</i>). There are cases
  in which the furcation takes place in the opposite direction, so that a nervure is double at the
  base of the wing (Fig. 161, I, A, 1<i>a</i>, and B, 1<i>b</i>). This important condition has not
  yet been adequately discussed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Turning to the mode of designation of the nervures,<a id="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> we may commence by remarking that no system satisfactory from
  a practical as well as from a theoretical point of view has yet been devised. The diagrams given
  in figure 161 will enable us to explain the methods actually in vogue; I. representing the system,
  dating from the time of Herrich-Schaeffer, chiefly used by British naturalists, and II. that
  adopted by Staudinger and Schatz in their recent great work on the Butterflies of the world. The
  three anterior nervures in both front and hind wings correspond fairly well, and are called,
  looking at them where they commence at the base of the wing, "costal," "subcostal," and "median"
  nervures. The nervures near the inner margin of the wing (that is the lower part in our figures)
  differ much in the front and hind wings, consisting either of two or of three separate portions
  not joined even at the base. British entomologists call these "branches or divisions of the
  internal nervure": the Germans call the more anterior of them the "submedian," and the more
  internal the "inner-margin nervure"; they are also frequently called anal nervures. The
  cross-nervure that closes the cell is called discocellular; when apparently composed of two or
  three <span class="pagenum" id="page319"><span class="smaller">{319}</span></span>parts joined so
  as to form angles, the parts are called, according to position, upper, lower, and middle
  discocellulars. One or more short spurs may exist on the front part of the basal portion of the
  hind wing; these are called praecostal. The branches or terminal divisions of the nervures should
  be called nervules; they are usually mentioned by the numbers shewn in the diagram (Fig. 161, I.).
  In addition to this, it is only necessary to remember that number 2 is always assigned to the
  posterior division of the median nervure, the nervules below this being all called 1, and
  distinguished by the addition of <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> when requisite. This course is
  necessary, because if it were not adopted the corresponding nervules on the front and hind wings
  would bear different numbers.</p>

  <p>The use of this system of numbers for the nervules is becoming general, and it answers fairly
  well for practical purposes. On the other hand, extreme discrepancy exists as to the nomenclature
  of the nervures and nervules, and there are almost as many systems as there are authorities.</p>

  <p>The normal number of nervules is, on the front wing, 11 + 1 or 2 inner marginal, and on the
  hind wing 7 + 2 or 3 inner marginal. In the aberrant moths of the genus <i>Castnia</i> the
  nervuration is unusually complex and irregular (Fig. 162), and an analogous condition occurs in
  our common Goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>). In <i>Hepialus</i> and <i>Micropteryx</i> (the
  jugate moths of Comstock) the hind wings are less dissimilar in nervuration from the front wings
  than they are in other Lepidoptera.<a id="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Internal Anatomy.</b><a id="NtA_179" href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a>&mdash;The
  alimentary canal extends as a long, <span class="pagenum" id="page320"><span
  class="smaller">{320}</span></span>slender oesophagus through the length of the thorax, dilating
  when it reaches the abdomen to form a tubular stomach; before this it is somewhat enlarged to form
  an indistinct crop, and gives off a large diverticulum usually called a sucking stomach. According
  to Burgess, this structure does not possess the function ascribed to it by this name, and he terms
  it a food-reservoir. The Malpighian tubes are six in number, three on each side, and each set of
  three unite to form a common tube opening into the posterior extremity of the stomach; behind them
  the alimentary canal continues in the form of a slender, tortuous intestine, expanding at the
  extremity of the body to form a rectum. The dorsal or circulatory vessel commences near the
  posterior extremity of the body, but in the front part of the abdomen is deflexed to pass under
  the great phragma into the thorax, where it rises abruptly to the dorsal wall, but is again
  abruptly deflexed, forming a loop, and is then prolonged above the oesophagus into the head: at
  the summit of the thoracic loop there may be a dilatation called the aortal chamber. The supra-
  and infra-oesophageal ganglia are consolidated into a mass pierced by the oesophagus: there is a
  minute frontal ganglion; the ventral chain consists of three much approximated thoracic ganglia
  and four abdominal ganglia separated from the thoracic by a long interval.</p>

  <p>The male sexual organs consist of the two testes placed in a common capsule, from which proceed
  a pair of contiguous vasa deferentia (dilated soon after their origin to form the vesiculae
  seminales); into each vas there opens a long, tubular gland; the two vasa subsequently unite to
  form a long, coiled, ejaculatory duct. It is in the structure of the female sexual organs that the
  most remarkable of the anatomical characters of Lepidoptera is found, there being two external
  sexual orifices. The imago has, in the great majority of cases, four egg-tubes in each ovary; the
  pair of oviducts proceeding from them unite to form a single unpaired (azygos) oviduct which
  terminates by an orifice quite at the posterior extremity of the body. There is a sac, the bursa
  copulatrix or copulatory pouch, which is prolonged in a tubular manner, to open externally on the
  eighth ventral plate: a tube, the seminal duct, connects the bursa with the oviduct, and on this
  tube there may be a dilatation&mdash;the spermatheca. Besides these structures two sets of
  accessory glands open into the oviduct, an unpaired gland, and a pair of glands. The development
  of these structures has been described by Hatchett Jackson,<a id="NtA_180"
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> and exhibits some very interesting features. The exact
  functions of the bursa copulatrix and of the other structures are by no means clear. According to
  Riley,<a id="NtA_181" href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> the spermatheca in <i>Pronuba</i>
  contains some curious radiate bodies, and Godman and Salvin describe something of the same sort as
  existing in butterflies. Several variations in the details of the structure of these remarkably
  complex passages have been described, and the various ducts are sometimes rendered more complex by
  diverticula attached to them. Some noteworthy diversities in the main anatomical features exist.
  According to Cholodkovsky, there is but one sexual aperture&mdash;the posterior one&mdash;in
  <i>Nematois metallicus</i>; while, according to Brandt, the number of egg-tubes in a few cases
  exceeds the normal&mdash;four&mdash;being in <i>Sesia scoliaeformis</i> fourteen. In <i>Nematois
  metallicus</i> there is individual variation, the number of tubes varying from twelve to
  twenty.</p>

  <p>The <b>egg</b> has been more extensively studied in Lepidoptera than in any other Order of
  Insects. It displays great variety: we meet with elongate forms (Fig. 164) and flat forms like
  buttons, while in <i>Limacodes</i> (Fig. 83, Vol. V.) the egg is a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page322"><span class="smaller">{322}</span></span>transparent scale of somewhat inconstant
  outline. Some are coloured and mottled somewhat after the fashion of birds'-eggs; this is the case
  with some eggs of Lasiocampidae and Liparidae; in some the sculpture of the egg-shell is of the
  most elaborate character (Figs. 77, 78, Vol. V.). The egg-shell or chorion is, according to
  Korschelt<a id="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> and others, a cuticular product of
  the epithelium of the egg-chambers of the ovaries. The number of eggs deposited by an individual
  differs greatly in different species, and has been ascertained to be variable within certain
  limits in the same species. Speyer thought about 250 to be the average number of eggs deposited by
  an individual. The number in the case of <i>Aporia crataegi</i> is believed to be from 60 to 100,
  and in some <i>Hepialus</i> to be several thousands. The mode of deposition also differs greatly;
  where the eggs are very numerous they seem to be discharged almost at random in suitable spots;
  but moths such as <i>Clisiocampa neustria</i> fasten their eggs round the stems of the food-plant
  in a very perfect and artistic manner. Butterflies seem as a rule to prefer to oviposit by placing
  an egg here and there rather than risk many in one situation; but to this there are many
  conspicuous exceptions especially in the cases where the larvae live gregariously, as in the
  Vanessae. Some moths cover the eggs with fur from their own body, which, in the case of certain of
  the Eggers (Lasiocampidae), seems to have a special supply for the purpose. The period that
  intervenes between deposition and hatching of the eggs varies from a few days to many months.
  There seems to be, as a rule, comparatively little power of extending the period of latency beyond
  a single season; though certain facts have been recorded that would lead us to believe that in
  Australia eggs may last over the proper time during a drought, and be hatched as soon as rain
  falls.</p>

  <p><b>Larva.</b>&mdash;The young condition or larva of the Lepidopterous Insect is commonly called
  a caterpillar.  It is a somewhat worm-like creature&mdash;in old English it was sometimes called
  <span class="pagenum" id="page323"><span class="smaller">{323}</span></span>palmer-worm&mdash;and
  is composed of a head and thirteen divisions or segments of the body; the first three of the
  latter are called thoracic, the other ten, abdominal segments; in most caterpillars the terminal
  two or three abdominal segments are more or less run together, and the ninth may be very small, so
  that the true number is indistinct. The first three segments bear each, on either side, a short
  limb, ending in a curved spine; the next two (or three or more) segments are destitute of legs,
  but on some of the following divisions another kind of leg of a more fleshy character appears,
  while the body is terminated by a pair of these thick legs of somewhat different form. The front
  legs are usually called the true legs, the others prolegs, but this latter designation is a most
  unfortunate one, the term "pro" being in entomology used to signify anterior; it is therefore
  better to call the three anterior pairs thoracic legs, and the others abdominal feet,
  distinguishing the hind pair of these latter as claspers. There is, too, an unfortunate
  discrepancy amongst entomologists in their manner of counting the body-segments, some count the
  head as the first segment, while others apply this term to the first thoracic segment. The latter
  is the more correct course, for, as the head is not a single segment it should not be called such
  in a terminology that affects to be morphologically exact, not simply descriptive. The thoracic
  legs are transversely jointed (Fig. 165, B), but this is not the case with the abdominal feet,
  which are usually armed beneath with a circle, or with rows, of little hooks. The thoracic legs
  are, independent of their form, of a different nature from the abdominal, for these latter
  disappear subsequently, while the former give rise to the legs of the imago. The number of
  thoracic legs is always six, except in a few cases where there are none at all; the abdominal feet
  are much more variable, and exhibit so many distinctions that we cannot here attempt to deal with
  them. M. Goossens has given a concise and interesting account of this subject,<a id="NtA_183"

  enormous, and the silk-vessels are also very extensive.</p>

  <p>There are three sets of glands opening by canals on the head, viz. the salivary glands proper,
  which open into the cavity of the mouth, one close to the base of each mandible; the silk-glands,
  which terminate by a common canal, continued externally as the spinneret; and the glands of
  Filippi situate in the head itself, and opening into the ducts of the silk-glands, near their
  union into a common duct. It should be recollected that Fig. 165 does not indicate all the details
  of the anatomy; the muscular system, for instance, being entirely omitted, though there are an
  enormous number of muscles; these however are not very complex, they being mostly repetitions in
  the successive segments.<a id="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> The mouth-parts are
  very different from those of the perfect Insect, inasmuch as the maxillae and labial palpi, which
  are the most remarkable structures of the imago, are small, and are differently constructed in the
  caterpillar, while the mandibles, which are the largest organs of the caterpillar, disappear in
  the adult. The little organ by which the caterpillar exudes its silk is called a spinneret;
  according to Packard it is a "homologue of the hypopharynx." It is a more or less prominent point
  on the middle of the labium (Fig. 166, <i>g</i>) and sometimes forms a conspicuous spine
  projecting downwards. The eyes are extremely imperfect organs, consisting merely of six, in some
  cases <span class="pagenum" id="page325"><span class="smaller">{325}</span></span>fewer,
  transparent, somewhat prominent, little spaces placed on each side of the lower part of the head;
  they are called "ocelli," by Landois "ocelli compositi." Under each of these external facets there
  are placed percipient structures, apparently very imperfect functionally, the caterpillar's sight
  being of the poorest character.<a id="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> The spiracles
  of the caterpillar are nine on each side, placed one on the first thoracic segment and one on each
  of the first eight abdominal segments; there are no true stigmata on the second and third thoracic
  segments, though traces of their rudiments or vestiges are sometimes visible.</p>

  <p>In the caterpillar there are no traces of the external sexual organs, so that the two sexes
  cannot be distinguished on superficial inspection; it was however long ago demonstrated by
  Herold<a id="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> that the ovaries and testes exist in the
  youngest caterpillars, and undergo a certain amount of growth and development in the larval
  instars; the most important feature of which is that the testes are originally separate but
  subsequently coalesce in the middle line of the body, and become enclosed in a common capsule. In
  a few forms&mdash;especially of Liparidae&mdash;(Lymantriidae of modern authors)&mdash;the
  caterpillars are said to be of different colours in the two sexes. Most of what is known on this
  point has been referred to by Hatchett Jackson.<a id="NtA_188"
  href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Silk-glands of Lepidoptera are of great interest from the physiological point of view, as
  well as from the fact that they have furnished for many ages one of the most beautiful of the
  adornments made use of by our own species. The sericteria, or vessels that secrete silk, are of
  simple structure, and differ greatly in their size in the various forms of the Order; they
  sometimes become of great length; in the Silk-worm each of the two vessels is nearly five times as
  long as the body, while in <i>Bombyx yamamai</i> and others, even this is exceeded. They <span
  class="pagenum" id="page326"><span class="smaller">{326}</span></span>grow with remarkable
  rapidity, being in the young silk-worm only 3 mm. long, in the adult 22 mm. The increase in weight
  is still more remarkable; when the silk-worm is thirty-one days old, the sericteria weigh only 3
  mgr., but when the age is fifty days their weight has increased to 541 mgr., being then &#x2156;
  of the whole weight of the body. In the pupa they undergo a gradual atrophy, and in the moth they
  are, according to Helm, no longer to be found, though earlier authors were of a contrary
  opinion.<a id="NtA_189" href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> According to Joseph,<a id="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> the silk-vessels begin to develop at an extremely early age of
  the embryo, and are very different in their nature from the salivary glands, the former being
  derivatives of the external integument (ectoderm), while the salivary glands belong to the
  alimentary system. This view is to some extent confirmed by the observations of Gilson as to the
  different manner in which these two sets of glands discharge their functions.</p>

  <p>The chief feature in the anatomy of the larva is the great size of the stomach. There is a very
  short oesophagus and crop; the latter becomes enlarged, spreading out so as to form the stomach, a
  great sac occupying the larger part of the body-cavity (Fig. 165). On the hinder end of this sac
  the Malpighian tubes open; they are similar in their disposition to those of the imago; behind the
  stomach the canal expands into two successive, short dilatations, the first called an intestine,
  the second a rectum; they are connected by very short isthmuses. The dorsal vessel is a simple,
  slender tube, extending from the eighth abdominal segment to the head. The main nervous system
  consists of supra- and infra-oesophageal ganglia, a small frontal ganglion, and a ventral chain of
  eleven ganglia, three thoracic and eight abdominal, the last of these latter being double. The
  sexual organs are quite rudimentary, and the passages connected with them very incompletely
  developed.</p>

  <p><b>Pupa.</b>&mdash;The pupa, which is one of the most remarkable of the instars of an Insect's
  life, attains its highest development in Lepidoptera. The Lepidopterous pupa is frequently called
  a "chrysalis," a term originally applied to certain metallic butterfly pupae. The Lepidopterous
  pupa differs from that of other Insects in the fact that its outer skin forms a hard shell, all
  the appendages of <span class="pagenum" id="page327"><span class="smaller">{327}</span></span>the
  body being glued together by an exudation so as to form a single continuous outer skin. This form
  of perfect pupa is called "pupa obtecta." The obtected pupa is exhibited in various stages of
  perfection in the Lepidoptera; the maximum of perfection is attained by the pupae of such
  butterflies as are exposed without protection or concealment; on the other hand, we find in
  various small moths conditions of the pupa that do not differ in any marked manner from the pupae
  of Insects of other Orders. Moreover, certain Coleoptera and Diptera exhibit obtected pupae of a
  more or less perfect kind. Hence the pupa obtecta is to be considered as a perfected condition
  that exists more frequently in the Lepidoptera than in other Orders.</p>

  <p>The pupa has no orifices to the alimentary canal or sexual organs, but the respiratory openings
  are pervious. It has no means of locomotion, but it can move a certain number of the posterior
  segments (the number variable according to kind). In some cases it is provided with spines,
  "adminicula," by means of which, aided by the wriggling movements of the abdominal segments,
  considerable changes of position can be effected. The pupae of the genus <i>Micropteryx</i>
  apparently use the legs for locomotion, as do the pupae of Trichoptera.</p>

  <p>The study of the pupa of Lepidoptera is less advanced than that of the imago and larva, between
  which it is, in many points of structure, intermediate.<a id="NtA_191"
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> The interior of the pupa contains a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page328"><span class="smaller">{328}</span></span>quantity of cream-like matter, including the

  much according to whether the change from the caterpillar to the moth is much or little
  advanced.</p>

  <p>Many pupae are protected by cocoons. These are masses of silk&mdash;very various in
  form&mdash;disposed by the caterpillar around itself during the last stage of its existence. Some
  of these cocoons are so perfect that the moth has considerable difficulty in escaping when the
  metamorphosis is complete. Various devices are used for the purpose of emergence; the Puss-moth
  excretes a corrosive fluid, containing potassium hydroxide, and then protects itself from this by
  retaining on the head while passing through it a shield formed of a portion of the pupa-skin.<a
  id="NtA_192" href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> Lepidopterous pupae usually have the body
  terminated by a projection of very various and peculiar form called "cremaster." In certain cases
  these projections are used for the suspension of the pupa, and are then frequently provided with
  hooks (Fig. 177, C, D). In other cases the cremaster is frequently called the anal armature (Fig.
  205, B).</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <b>development</b> of the <b>wings</b> of Lepidoptera has recently been much studied. It
  has been known since the time of Lyonnet, that the rudiments of the wings exist inside the body of
  the caterpillar when it is nearly adult. Verson considers that he has detected the rudiments in
  the silk-worm larva even before hatching, and he attributes their origin to a modification of form
  of those hypodermal cells that occupy the spots where the spiracles of the second and third
  thoracic segments might be looked for. (It will be recollected that there are no spiracles on
  these two thoracic segments in Lepidopterous larvae). Gonin has examined the wing-rudiments in the
  caterpillar, a few days old, of <span class="pagenum" id="page329"><span
  class="smaller">{329}</span></span><i>Pieris brassicae</i>,<a id="NtA_193"
  href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> and finds that the future wing is then indicated by a
  thickening and bagging inwards of the hypodermis, and by some embryonic cells and a trachea in
  close relation with this mass (Fig. 168, A). The structure grows so as to form a sac projecting to
  the interior of the body, connected with the body-wall by a pedicel, and penetrated by a trachea
  forming branches consisting of rolled and contorted small tracheae (Fig. 168, B). If the body-wall
  be dissected off the caterpillar immediately before pupation the wings appear in crumpled form, as
  shown in Fig. 169. This fact was known to the older entomologists, and gave rise to the idea that
  the butterfly could be detected in a caterpillar by merely stripping off the integument.</p>

  <p>The exact mode by which the wings become external at the time of appearance of the chrysalis is
  not ascertained; but it would appear from Gonin's observations that it is not by a process of
  evagination, but by destruction of the hypodermis lying outside the wing. However this may be, it
  is well known that, when the caterpillar's skin is finally shed and the chrysalis appears, the
  wings are free, external appendages, and soon become fastened down to the body by an exudation
  that hardens so as to form the shell of the chrysalis.</p>

  <p><b>Scales and nervures.</b>&mdash;Before tracing the further development it will be well to
  discuss the structure of the scales and nervures that form such important features in the
  Lepidopterous wing.</p>

  <p>If a section be made of the perfect wing of a Lepidopteron, it is found that the two layers or
  walls of the wing are firmly held together by material irregularly arranged, in a somewhat
  columnar manner. The thickness of the wing is much greater where the section cuts through a
  nervure (Fig. 170, A). The nervures apparently differ as to the structures found in them. Spuler
  observed in a nervure of <i>Triphaena pronuba</i>, a body having in section a considerable
  diameter, that he considered to be a <span class="pagenum" id="page330"><span
  class="smaller">{330}</span></span>trachea, and also a "wing-rib" and blood-cells. He remarks that
  even in nervures, perfectly formed as to their chitinous parts, either wing-rib or trachea or both
  may be absent.<a id="NtA_194" href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> Sch&auml;ffer<a id="NtA_195"
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> was unable to find any tracheae in the completed wings he
  examined, and he states that the matrix of the tracheae and even their inner linings disappear.
  The wing-ribs were, however, found by him to be present (Fig. 170, A and B).</p>

  <p>The scales that form so conspicuous a feature in Lepidoptera exist in surprising profusion, and
  are of the most varied forms. They may be briefly described as delicate, chitinous bags; in the
  completed state these bags are flattened, so as to bring the sides quite, or very nearly,
  together. Their colour is due to contained pigments, or to striation of the exposed surface of the
  scale; the latter condition <span class="pagenum" id="page331"><span
  class="smaller">{331}</span></span>giving rise to metallic "interference-colours." The walls of
  the scales are themselves, in some cases, tinted with pigment.  It is said that some of the scales
  contain air, and that the glistening whiteness of certain scales is due to this. The exposed
  surface of the scale usually differs from the surface that is pressed down on the wing in being
  delicately and regularly striated; the colours of the upper and under surfaces of a scale may also
  be quite different.  Scales are essentially of the nature of hairs, and all the transitions
  between hairs and true scales may be found on the wings of certain Lepidoptera that bear both
  hairs and scales, e.g. <i>Ithomia</i>. It has been calculated that there are a million and a half
  of scales on the wings of an individual of the genus <i>Morpho</i>. The scales are arranged on the
  wing in an overlapping manner, somewhat like slates on the roof of a house.  Each scale has a
  short stalk, and is maintained in position by the stalk fitting into a cavity in a projection of
  the wing-membrane (Fig. 172).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Androconia.</b>&mdash;The males of numerous butterflies possess scales peculiar in kind and
  various in arrangement. They may be either irregularly scattered over the wing, or they may form
  very complex definite structures (Fig. 173). They were formerly called "plumules," but Scudder has
  replaced this name by the better one, "androconia." The function of the androconia is still
  obscure. An odour is believed to be connected with them. Thomas supposes<a id="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> that these scales are hollow tubes in connection with glands
  at their bases, and that matter secreted by the glands passes through the scales and becomes
  diffused. In nearly all Lepidoptera it is the male that seeks the female; if therefore odorous
  scales were present in one sex only we should have supposed that this would have been the female
  rather than the male. As, however, the reverse is the case, the function of the androconia is
  supposed to be that of charming the female. Scudder considers that the covering part of the
  androconial <span class="pagenum" id="page332"><span class="smaller">{332}</span></span>structures
  is sometimes ornamental. As a rule, however, the "brands" of male Lepidoptera detract from their
  beauty to our eyes.</p>

  <p>Resuming our consideration of the <b>development</b> of the <b>wings</b>, we may remark that
  the history of the changes during the pupal state is still imperfect. By the changes of relative
  size of the thoracic segments the hind wing is brought to lie under the anterior one (<i>i.e.</i>
  between it and the body), so that in the newly formed pupa the arrangement is that shown in Fig.
  174. The wings are two sacs filled with material surrounding peritracheal spaces in which run
  tracheae. The subsequent history of the tracheae is very obscure, and contrary opinions have been
  expressed as to their growth and disappearance. We have alluded to the fact that in some nervures
  tracheae are present, while in others they are absent; so that it is quite possible that <span
  class="pagenum" id="page333"><span class="smaller">{333}</span></span>the histories of the
  formation of the nervures and of their relation to tracheae are different in various Lepidoptera.
  This conclusion is rendered more probable by the statement of Comstock and Needham,<a id="NtA_197"
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> that in some Insects the "peritracheal spaces" that mark out
  the position of the future nervures are destitute of tracheae. Gonin thinks the nervures are
  derived from the sheaths of the peritracheal spaces, and a review of all the facts suggests that
  the tracheae have only a secondary relation to the nervures, and that the view that a study of the
  pupal tracheae may be looked on as a study of the preliminary state of the nervures is not
  sufficiently exact. It is, however, probable that in Lepidoptera the pupal tracheae play an
  important though not a primary part in the formation of the nervures; possibly this may be by
  setting up changes in the cells near them by means of the air they supply. Semper long ago
  discovered hypodermal cylinders traversed by a string (Fig. 170, B), placed near the tracheae in
  the pupa.<a id="NtA_198" href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> It appears probable that the
  "wing-ribs" found in the nervures (Fig. 170, A <i>fr</i> and B) are the final state of these
  cylinders, but the origin and import of the cylinders are still unknown.</p>

  <p>The formation of the scales of the wing commences very early&mdash;apparently soon after the
  casting of the larval skin&mdash;though the completion of the scales and their pigmentation is
  delayed to a late period of the pupal life. The scales are formed by special cells of the
  hypodermis that are placed deeper in the interior of the wing than the other hypodermal cells.
  Each scale is formed by one cell, and protrudes through the overlying hypodermis; the membrane
  into which the scales are inserted is a subsequently developed structure, and the beautiful <span
  class="pagenum" id="page334"><span class="smaller">{334}</span></span>articulation of the scale
  with the wing takes place by a division of the stalk of the scale where it is encompassed by the

  an excretory vesicle.</p>

  <p>Very little is positively known as to the development of the colour in the wing-scales. It has
  been pointed out by Hopkins<a id="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> that in some cases
  the colours are of the nature of urates; that is, of excretory matter of the kind that usually
  passes from the body by direct channels, and in the case of Lepidoptera, by the Malpighian tubes.
  Miss Newbigin suggests that the organic pigments used in scale-coloration will be found to be of
  two kinds, urates and melanins, the urates being derivatives from nitrogenous, the melanins from
  carbonaceous, matters.<a id="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> Marchal, who has devoted
  a great deal of attention to the study of the Malpighian tubes, informs us that the subdermal
  pigments of caterpillars are frequently in large part deposits of urates, and he is of opinion
  that, the function of the Malpighian tubes being arrested at certain periods of the metamorphosis,
  elimination of the matter they separate when functionally active then takes place in a variety of
  other ways.<a id="NtA_201" href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> A similar condition as to the
  melanin-pigments and the respiratory functions appears also <span class="pagenum"
  id="page335"><span class="smaller">{335}</span></span>probable. The scales when first formed are
  pallid, and the physiology of their pigmentation is not fully ascertained; it is, however, known
  that when the scales are pallid the hypodermis is either pigmented or in close contact with
  pigmentary matter, and that as the scales become coloured this pigmentation of the hypodermis
  diminishes; so that it is clear that the colour of the scales is obtained from matter in the
  interior of the developing wing, and probably by the agency of the hypodermis.</p>

  <p>The pattern on the wings of Lepidoptera is formed before the emergence from the pupa. In the
  Tortoiseshell butterfly, according to Sch&auml;ffer, it commences to appear about the ninth day of the
  pupal life, and the pattern is completed about the eleventh or twelfth day. He also states that
  the process varies in its rapidity, and this, he thinks, may depend on the previous condition of
  the larva. According to Buckell the pupa of <i>Nemeobius lucina</i> is sufficiently transparent to
  allow the development of the colour of the imago to be watched. He says that the coloration
  occurred first in front; that its entire production occupied less than twenty-four hours, and only
  commenced about forty-eight hours before the imago emerged.<a id="NtA_202"
  href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> When the butterfly leaves the pupal skin the wings are soft,
  crumpled sacs, of comparatively small size, but, as everyone knows, they rapidly expand and become
  rigid; the physiology of this process is apparently still unknown.</p>

  <p>A great deal of evidence, both direct and indirect, has accumulated showing that the
  organisation of many Lepidoptera is excessively sensitive, so that slight changes of condition
  produce remarkable results; and it has also been shown that in the early part of the life this
  sensitiveness is especially great at the period of ecdysis. Numerous butterflies produce more than
  one generation a year, and sometimes the generations are so different that they have passed
  current with entomologists as distinct species. The phenomena of this character are styled
  "seasonal variations" or "seasonal dimorphism." It has, however, been shown that, by careful
  management, the eggs of a generation (say form <i>a</i>) may be made to produce form <i>a</i>,
  whereas in the usual course of nature they would produce form <i>b</i>. A very remarkable
  condition is exhibited by the North American <i>Papilio ajax</i>. There are three forms of the
  species, known as <i>P. ajax</i>, <i>P. telamonides</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page336"><span
  class="smaller">{336}</span></span>and <i>P. marcellus</i>. It is uncertain how many generations
  there may be in one year of this species, as the length of the life-cycle varies greatly according
  to circumstances. But in West Virginia all the butterflies of this species that emerge from the
  chrysalis before the middle of April are the form <i>marcellus</i>; those produced between the
  middle of April and the end of May are <i>telamonides</i>; while those that appear after this are
  <i>ajax</i>. <i>P. telamonides</i> is not, however, the offspring of <i>marcellus</i>, for both
  forms emerge from pupae that have passed through the winter (and are the offspring of
  <i>ajax</i>), those that emerge early being <i>marcellus</i>, those that appear later
  <i>telamonides</i>.</p>

  <p>In various parts of Asia and Africa the butterflies produced during the wet season differ more
  or less markedly from those of the same species produced during the dry season. These are called
  "wet" and "dry season" forms. Their aetiology has not been investigated, this discovery being
  comparatively recent.</p>

  <p>Turning to the early life we find that some larvae vary in colour, and that this variation is
  sometimes of a definite character, the larva being one of two different colours&mdash;green or
  brown. In other cases the variation of the species is less definitely dimorphic, a considerable
  range of variation being exhibited by the species. In tracing the life-histories of Lepidopterous
  larvae it is not rare to find species in which the larva abruptly changes its form and colour in
  the middle of its life, and so completely that no one would believe the identity of the individual
  in the two successive conditions had it not been shown by direct observation; in these cases the
  change in appearance is usually associated with a change in habits, the larva being, perhaps, a
  miner in leaves in its first stages, and an external feeder subsequently. In the case of the
  larval variation we have alluded to above, it is understood that there is no marked change of
  habits. Poulton has shown<a id="NtA_203" href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> that it is not
  infrequent for some of these latter kinds of variable larvae to change colour during life, and he
  considers that light or conditions of illumination, that he speaks of as "phytoscopic," are the
  inducing causes. Great difference is, however, exhibited according to species, some variable
  species not being so amenable to these influences as others are. In dimorphic forms the change was
  observed to take place at a moult, the larva changing its skin <span class="pagenum"
  id="page337"><span class="smaller">{337}</span></span>and appearing of another colour. In some
  cases the result of the change was to bring the colour of the larva into harmony with its
  surroundings, but in others it was not so. During the final stage many larvae are susceptible, the
  result being made evident only when the pupa is disclosed. Variably coloured pupae of certain
  species of butterflies have long been known, and it has been shown that some of the varieties can
  be induced by changing the surroundings. The result of the changes is in certain cases
  correspondence between the colour of the individual and its surroundings. In the case of other
  species having pupae of variable colour, the colour of the pupa is without relation to, or harmony
  with, the surroundings.</p>

  <p>Experiments have been made on pupae by Merrifield and others, with the result of showing that
  by changes of temperature applied at certain moments some of the colours or marks of the butterfly
  that will emerge can be altered.</p>

  <p>It is found that in certain localities the colour of various kinds of butterflies more or less
  agrees, while it differs from that of the same butterflies found in other localities. Thus Weir
  speaks of a duskiness common to various butterflies in Java, and calls it "phaeism"; and Bates
  states that in the Amazon valley numerous species of butterflies vary in a similar manner, as
  regards colour, in a locality. This phenomenon is now called "homoeochromatism," and is supposed
  to be due to the effect of local conditions on a susceptible organisation, though there is no
  experimental evidence of this.</p>

  <p><b>Mimicry.</b>&mdash;There are many cases in Lepidoptera of species that depart more or less
  strongly in appearance from those forms to which they are considered to be allied, and at the same
  time resemble more or less closely species to which they are less allied. This phenomenon is
  called mimicry.<a id="NtA_204" href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> Usually the resembling forms
  are actually associated during life. Bates, who observed this phenomenon in the Amazon valley,
  thought that it might be accounted for by the advantage resulting to the exceptionally coloured
  forms from the resemblance;<a id="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> it being assumed
  that these were unprotected, while the forms they resembled were <span class="pagenum"
  id="page338"><span class="smaller">{338}</span></span>believed to be specially protected by
  nauseous odours or taste. It was, in fact, thought that the destroying enemies were deceived by
  the resemblance into supposing that the forms that were in reality edible were inedible. This
  subject has been greatly discussed, and in the course of the discussion numerous cases that could
  not be accounted for by Bates's hypothesis have been revealed. One of these is the fact that
  resemblances of the kind alluded to very frequently occur amongst inedible forms. This also has
  been thought to be accounted for by a supposed advantage to the Insects; it being argued that a
  certain number of "protected" forms are destroyed by enemies the instincts of which are faulty,
  and which therefore always require to learn by individual experience that a certain sort of colour
  is associated with a nasty taste. The next step of the argument is that it will be an advantage to
  a protected butterfly to form part of a large association of forms having one coloration, because
  the ignorant enemies will more easily learn the association of a certain form of coloration with
  nastiness; moreover such destruction as does occur will be distributed over a larger number of
  species, so that each species of a large, similarly coloured, inedible association will have a
  less number of its individuals destroyed. It is scarcely a matter for surprise that many
  naturalists are very sceptical as to these explanations; especially as the phenomena are supposed
  to have occurred in the past, so that they cannot be directly verified or disproved. It has not,
  however, been found, as a matter of fact, that even unprotected butterflies are much destroyed in
  the perfect state by birds. Moreover, in endeavouring to realise the steps of the process of
  development of the resemblance, we meet with the difficulty that the amount of resemblance to the
  model that is assumed to be efficient at one step of the development, and to bring safety, is at
  the next step supposed to be inefficient and to involve destruction. In other words, while
  analysis of the explanation shows that it postulates a peculiar and well-directed discriminative
  power, and a persistent selection on the part of the birds, observation leads to the belief that
  birds have been but little concerned in the matter. If we add to this that there is no sufficient
  evidence that the species now similar were ever dissimilar (as it is supposed they were by the
  advocates of the hypothesis), we think it is clear that the explanation from our point of view is
  of but <span class="pagenum" id="page339"><span class="smaller">{339}</span></span>little
  importance.<a id="NtA_206" href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> The comparatively simple,
  hypothetical explanation, originally promulgated by Bates, is sometimes called Batesian mimicry;
  while the "inedible association" hypothesis is termed M&uuml;llerian mimicry.</p>

  <p>There is one branch of the subject of mimicry that we think of great interest. This is the
  resemblance between Insects of different Orders; or between Insects of the same Order, but
  belonging to groups that are essentially different in form and appearance. It is not infrequent
  for beetles to resemble Hymenoptera, and it is still more frequent for Lepidoptera to resemble
  Hymenoptera, and that not only in colour and form, but also in movements and attitude. Druce says:
  "Many of the species of Zygaenidae are the most wonderful of all the moths; in some cases they so
  closely resemble Hymenoptera that at first sight it is almost impossible to determine to which
  Order they belong."<a id="NtA_207" href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> W. M&uuml;ller says: "The little
  Lepidoptera of the family Glaucopides, that are so like certain wasps as to completely deceive us,
  have when alive exactly the same manner of holding their wings, the same restless movements, the
  same irregular flight as a wasp."<a id="NtA_208" href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> Seitz and
  others record a case in which a Brazilian <i>Macroglossa</i> exactly resembles a humming-bird, in
  company with which it flies; and the same naturalist also tells us<a id="NtA_209"
  href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> of a Skipper butterfly that greatly resembles a grasshopper of
  the genus <i>Tettix</i>, and that moreover makes movements like the jumping of grasshoppers. In
  most of these cases the probabilities of either original similarity, arrested evolution, or the
  action of similar conditions are excluded: and the hypothesis of the influence, by some means or
  other, of one organism on another is strongly suggested.</p>

  <p>The <b>classification</b> of Lepidoptera was said by Latreille a century ago to be a reproach
  to entomologists. Since that time an enormous number of new species and genera have been
  described, but only recently has much advance been made in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page340"><span class="smaller">{340}</span></span>the way of improvement of classification.
  The progress made has been limited to a better comprehension and definition of the families. The
  nervuration of the wings is the character most in vogue for this purpose. As regards the larger
  groups, and Phylogeny, there is a general opinion prevalent to the effect that Micropterygidae,
  Eriocephalidae and Hepialidae are in a comparatively primitive condition, but as to the relations
  of these families one with the other, or with other Lepidoptera, there is a wide difference of
  opinion.</p>

  <p>The primary divisions of the family most often met with in literature are:&mdash;either
  Rhopalocera (= butterflies) and Heterocera (= moths); or Macrolepidoptera and Microlepidoptera;
  the Macrolepidoptera including the butterflies and large moths, the Microlepidoptera being limited
  to the families Tineidae (now itself in process of division into numerous families) and
  Tortricidae; some entomologists including also Pyralidae, Pterophoridae and Orneodidae in
  Microlepidoptera. The division of all Lepidoptera into two series is merely a temporary device
  necessitated by imperfect acquaintance with morphology. The division into Macro- and Micro-
  lepidoptera is entirely unscientific.</p>

    <p class="sp0">Series II. <i>Heterocera</i> or Moths.&mdash;Antennae various in form, only
    rarely knobbed at the tip, and in such cases a frenulum present. In the large majority a
    frenulum is present, and the costal nervure of the hind-wing is either but little arched at the
    base (as in Fig. 161, I, B) or it has a large area between it and the front margin; but in
    certain families the hind wing is formed much as in Rhopalocera.</p>

  <p><b>Classification and Families of Butterflies.</b> Although considerable unanimity exists as to
  the natural groups of butterflies, there is much diversity of opinion as to what divisions are of
  equivalent value&mdash;some treating as sub-families groups that others call families&mdash;and as
  to the way the families should be combined. There is, however, a general agreement that the
  Hesperiidae are the most distinct of the families, and E. Reuter considers them a distinct
  sub-Order with the name Grypocera.<a id="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Four categories may be readily distinguished, as follows, viz<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>1. The majority of butterflies; having the first pair of legs more or less strikingly
    different from the other pairs; frequently very much smaller and not used as legs; when not very
    small, then differing according to sex of the same species, being smaller in the male than in
    the female; the part most peculiar is the tarsus, which is modified in various manners, but in
    the males of this great series is always destitute of its natural form of a succession of simple
    joints five in number. There is no pad on the front tibia.</p>
    <div class="bq2">
      <p class="ar">Fam. Nymphalidae, Erycinidae, Lycaenidae.</p>
      <p class="sp0">[The distinctions between these three families are found in the amount and kind
      of the abortion of the front legs; for definition refer to the heading of each of the
      families.]</p>
    </div>
    <p>2. The front legs are in general form like the other pairs; their tibiae have no pads; the
    claws of all the feet are bifid, and there is an empodium in connection with them.</p>
    <p class="ar">Fam. Pieridae.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page342"><span class="smaller">{342}</span></span></div>
    <p>3. The front legs are like the other pairs; their tibiae however possess pads; the claws are
    large, not bifid, and there is no empodium; the metanotum is completely exposed at the base of
    the abdomen.</p>
    <p class="ar">Fam. Papilionidae.</p>
    <p>4. The front legs are like the other pairs; their tibiae however possess pads; the claws are
    small, toothed at the base, and there is an empodium; the metanotum is concealed by the
    prolonged and overhanging mesonotum.</p>
    <p class="sp0 ar">Fam. Hesperiidae.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The relations between the families Erycinidae, Lycaenidae, and Nymphalidae are very intimate.
  All these have the front legs more or less modified, and the distinctions between the families
  depend almost entirely on generalisations as to these modifications. These facts have led Scudder
  to associate the Lycaenidae and Erycinidae in one group, which he terms "Rurales." It is however
  difficult to go so far and no farther; for the relations between both divisions of Rurales and the
  Nymphalidae are considerable. We shall subsequently find that the genus <i>Libythea</i> is by many
  retained as a separate family, chiefly because it is difficult to decide whether it should be
  placed in Erycinidae or in Nymphalidae. Hence it is difficult to see in this enormous complex of
  seven or eight thousand species more than a single great Nymphalo-Lycaenid alliance. The forms
  really cognate in the three families are however so few, and the number of species in the whole is
  so very large, that it is a matter of great convenience in practice to keep the three families
  apart. It is sufficient for larger purposes to bear in mind their intimate connexions.</p>

  <p>The Papilionidae and Pieridae are treated by many as two sub-divisions of one group. But we
  have not been able to find any justification for this in the existence of forms with connecting
  characters. Indeed it would, from this point of view, appear that the Pieridae are more closely
  connected with the Lycaenidae and Erycinidae than they are with Papilionidae; in one important
  character, the absence of the pad of the front tibia, the Nymphalo-Lycaenids and the Pierids
  agree. It has also been frequently suggested that the Papilionidae (in the larger sense just
  mentioned) might be associated with the Hesperiidae. But no satisfactory links have been brought
  to light; and if one of the more lowly Hesperiids, such as <i>Thanaos</i>, be compared with one of
  the lower Papilionidae, such as <i>Parnassius</i>, very little approximation can be perceived.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page343"><span class="smaller">{343}</span></span></div>

  <p>It appears, therefore, at present that Hesperiidae, Papilionidae, Pieridae, and the
  Nymphalo-Lycaenid complex are naturally distinct. But in the following review of the families and
  sub-families of butterflies, we shall, in accordance with the views of the majority of
  Lepidopterists, treat the Lycaenidae and Erycinidae as families distinct from both Nymphalidae and
  Pieridae.<a id="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The number of described species of butterflies is probably about 13,000; but the list is at
  present far from complete; forms of the largest size and most striking appearance being still
  occasionally discovered. Forty years ago the number known was not more than one-third or
  one-fourth of what it is at present, and a crowd of novelties of the less conspicuous kinds is
  brought to light every year. Hence it is not too much to anticipate that 30,000, or even 40,000
  forms may be acquired if entomologists continue to seek them with the enthusiasm and industry that
  have been manifested of late. On the other hand, the species of Rhopalocera seem to be peculiarly
  liable to dimorphic, to seasonal and to local variation; so that it is possible that ultimately
  the number of true species&mdash;that is, forms that do not breed together actually or by means of
  intermediates, morphological or chronological&mdash;may have to be considerably reduced.</p>

  <p>In Britain we have a list of only sixty-eight native butterflies, and some even of these are
  things of the past, while others are only too certainly disappearing. New Zealand is still poorer,
  possessing only eighteen; and this number will probably be but little increased by future
  discoveries. South America is the richest part of the world, and Wallace informs us that 600
  species of butterflies could, forty years ago, be found in the environs of the city of Par&aacute;.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Nymphalidae.</b>&mdash;<i>The front pair of legs much reduced in size in each sex,
  their tarsi in the male with but one joint, <span class="pagenum" id="page344"><span
  class="smaller">{344}</span></span>though in the female there are usually five but without any
  claws. Pupa suspended by the tail so as to hang down freely.</i> We include in this family several
  sub-families treated by some taxonomists as families; in this respect we follow Bates, whose
  arrangement<a id="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> still remains the basis of
  butterfly classification. With this extension the Nymphalidae is the most important of the
  families of butterflies, and includes upwards of 250 genera, and between 4000 and 5000 species.
  There are eight sub-families.</p>

  <p>It is in Nymphalidae that the act of pupation reaches its acme of complication and perfection;
  the pupae hang suspended by the tail, and the cremaster, that is the process at the end of the
  body, bears highly-developed hooks (Fig. 177, C, D). The variety in form of the chrysalids is
  extraordinary; humps or processes often project from the body, making the Insect a fantastic
  object; the strange appearance is frequently increased by patches like gold or silver, placed on
  various parts of the body. It is believed that the term chrysalid was first suggested by these
  golden pup&aelig;. The Purple Emperor, <i>Apatura iris</i>, differs strikingly in the pupa as well as in
  the larva-stage from all our other Nymphalids; it is of green colour, very broad along the sides,
  but narrow on the dorsal and ventral aspects (Fig. 177). The skin of this pupa is less hard than
  usual, and the pupa seems to be of a very delicate constitution. The Purple Emperor, like some of
  the Satyrides as well as some of its more immediate congeners, hibernates in our climate as a
  partially grown larva and passes consequently only a very brief period of its existence in the
  form of a pupa.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Danaides.</b>&mdash;<i>Front wing with inner-margin <span class="pagenum"
  id="page345"><span class="smaller">{345}</span></span>(submedian) nervure, with a short fork at
  the base. Cell of hind wing closed. Front foot of the female ending in a corrugate knob.
  Caterpillars smooth, provided with a few long fleshy processes.</i> The claws are in a variable
  state, being sometimes simple, as in Papilionidae, sometimes with an empodium, apparently of an
  imperfect kind. The Danaides are usually large Insects with an imperfect style of ornament and
  colour; they have a great deal of black or very dark scaling, and in some <i>Euploea</i> this is
  agreeably relieved by a violet or purple suffusion, and these are really fine Insects. Usually
  there are large pale spaces, of some neutral indefinite tint, on which black blotches are
  distributed in a striking but inartistic manner. In many of the species the markings are almost
  spot for spot the same on the upper and under sides. About seven genera and 250 species are
  recognised. Danaides occur in all the warmer parts of the world, but are most numerous in the
  Eastern tropics. In Europe the family is represented only by an Asiatic and African species,
  <i>Limnas chrysippus</i>, that has extended its range to Greece. Besides this another species,
  <i>Anosia erippus</i>, Cr. (unfortunately also called <i>Anosia menippe</i>, Hb., and <i>Danais
  archippus</i> or even <i>D. plexippus</i>) has in the last two or three decades extended its range
  to various islands and distant localities, concomitantly, it is believed, with an extension of the
  distribution of its food-plant, <i>Asclepias</i>. This Insect has several times been taken in this
  country, and may probably be a natural immigrant. It is a common butterfly in North America, where
  it is called the Monarch.<a id="NtA_214" href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some, at least, of the Danaides are unpleasant to birds in odour or in taste, or both. Among
  them there occur, according to Moore<a id="NtA_215" href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> and
  others, numerous cases of resemblance between forms that are thus protected. It is possible that
  the odour and taste are of some value to the Insects;<a id="NtA_216"
  href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> as, however, butterflies of any kind appear to be but rarely
  attacked in the imago-state by birds, and as their chief enemies are parasitic Insects that attack
  the larval instar, it is impossible to consider this protection of such prime importance to the
  species as many theorists assume it to be.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Ithomiides.</b>&mdash;<i>Differs from Danaides by the female front foot having a
  true, though somewhat abbreviate tarsus. The caterpillers have no long processes.</i> There has
  been considerable difference of opinion as to this division of butterflies. It is the family
  Neotropidae of Schatz, the Mechanitidae of Berg; also the "Danaioid Heliconiidae" of several
  previous writers, except that <i>Ituna</i> and <i>Lycorea</i> do not belong here but to Danaides.
  Godman and Salvin treat it as a group of the Danaid sub-family. The Ithomiides are peculiar to
  tropical America, where some 20 or 30 genera and about 500 species have been discovered. There is
  considerable variety amongst them. <i>Ithomia</i> and <i>Hymenitis</i> are remarkable for the
  small area of their wings, which bear remarkably few scales, these ornaments being in many cases
  limited to narrow bands along the margins of the wings, and a mark extending along the
  discocellular nervule. Wallace says they prefer the shades of the forest and flit, almost
  invisible, among the dark foliage. Many of these species have the hind-wings differently veined in
  the two sexes on the anterior part, in connection with the existence in the male of peculiar fine
  hairs, placed near the costal and subcostal veins. <i>Tithorea</i> and other forms are, however,
  heavily scaled insects of stronger build, their colours usually being black, tawny-red or brown,
  yellow, and white. In the sub-fam. Danaides, according to Fritz M&uuml;ller, the male has scent-tufts
  at the extremity of the abdomen, whereas in Ithomiides analogous structures exist on the upper
  side of the hind-wing. Ithomiides have various colour-resemblances with members of the
  Heliconiides and Pieridae; <i>Tithorea</i> has colour analogues in <i>Heliconius</i>, and
  <i>Ithomia</i> in <i>Dismorphia</i> (formerly called <i>Leptalis</i>). Crowds of individuals of
  certain species of <i>Ithomia</i> are occasionally met with, and mixed with them there are found a
  small number of examples of <i>Dismorphia</i> coloured like themselves. They are placed by Haase
  in his category of secondary models. Belt states that some Ithomiides are distasteful to monkeys
  and spiders, but are destroyed by Fossorial Hymenoptera, which use the butterflies as food for
  their young; and he also says that <span class="pagenum" id="page347"><span
  class="smaller">{347}</span></span>they are very wary when the wasp is near, and rise off their
  perches into the air, as if aware that the wasp will not then endeavour to seize them. Much
  information is given about the habits by Bates in the paper in which he first propounded the
  "theory of mimicry."<a id="NtA_217" href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> The larvae are said to
  live on Solanaceae.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Hamadryas</i> is placed by some writers in Danaides, by others in Ithomiides; and
  Haase has proposed to make it the group "Palaeotropinae." The species are small, black and white
  Insects, somewhat like Pierids. They are apparently hardy Insects, and are abundant in certain
  parts of the Austro-Malay region.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Satyrides.</b>&mdash;<i>Palpi strongly pressed together, set in front with long,
  stiff hairs. Front wings frequently with one or more of the nervures swollen or bladder-like at
  the base of the wing. Cells of both wings closed. Caterpillar thickest at the middle, the hind end
  of the body bifid. Pupa generally suspended by the cremaster, without girth: but sometimes
  terrestrial.</i> This is a very extensive group, consisting of upwards of 1000 species. The
  Insects are usually of small size, of various shades of brown or greyish colours, with circular or
  ringed marks on the under sides of the wings. It is found all over the world, and is well
  represented in Europe; our Meadow-browns, Heaths, and Marbled-whites, as well as the great genus
  <i>Erebia</i> of the highlands and mountains belonging to it. Most of these Insects have but
  feeble powers of flight, and rise but little from the surface of the ground. The caterpillars live
  on various grasses. They are usually green or brown, destitute of armature, and a good deal like
  the caterpillars of Noctuid moths, but the hind end of the body is thinner and divided to form two
  corners, while the head is more or less free, or outstanding. The pupae are of great interest,
  inasmuch as in a few cases they do not suspend themselves in any way, but lie on the ground;
  sometimes in a very feeble cocoon or cell. There are no cremasteral hooks. The pupae of the
  Grayling butterfly, <i>Hipparchia semele</i>, has been found in loose soil a quarter of an inch
  below the surface. The chrysalis of the Scotch Argus, <i>Erebia aethiops</i>, was found by Mr.
  Buckler to be neither suspended nor attached, but placed in a perpendicular position, head
  upwards, amongst the grass. <span class="pagenum" id="page348"><span
  class="smaller">{348}</span></span>In the majority of cases the pupa is, however, suspended as is
  usual in Nymphalidae. Nothing is known as to the nature of the peculiar inflation of the bases of
  the nervures of the front wings; it is well shown in our common species of <i>Coenonympha</i>;
  this character is not, however, constant throughout the family. There is in South America a very
  remarkable group of Satyrides consisting of the genera <i>Cithaerias</i> and <i>Haetera</i>, in
  which the wings are very delicate and transparent, bearing on the greater part of their area
  remote fine hairs instead of scales; there are nevertheless some scaled patches about the margins,
  and one or more of the ringed marks characteristic of the Satyrides; while in some species the
  distal portions of the hind wings are tinted with carmine. The species of the genus
  <i>Pierella</i> connect these transparent Satyrids with the more ordinary forms. According to
  Wallace the habits of these fairy-like forms are those characteristic of the family in general.
  The genus <i>Elymnias</i> has been separated by some authorities as a sub-family, or even as a
  family, Elymniidae, chiefly on the ground of a slight peculiarity in the termination of the
  branches of the veins at the outer angle of the front wings. The <i>Elymnias</i> are said to be of
  a mimetic nature, having a greater or less resemblance to butterflies of various other divisions;
  there is also a considerable difference in appearance between their own sexes. The larva of <i>E.
  undularis</i> is known; it is of the form usual in Satyrides, and lives on the palm
  <i>Corypha</i>. About 50 species, ranging from India to Australia, with two in Africa, are known
  of this interesting group.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 4. Morphides.</b>&mdash;<i>There is no cell on the hind wing, the discocellular
  nervule being absent</i> (Fig. 161, II. B). <i>Caterpillars smooth or spiny, with the extremity of
  the body divided; frequently gregarious.</i> These Insects have become notorious from the
  extraordinary brilliancy of blue colour exhibited by the upper surface of the wings of the typical
  genus <i>Morpho</i>. The species of <i>Morpho</i> are all Insects of large size, but with wings
  enormous in proportion to the body; this latter part is carried in a sort of cradle formed by the
  inner parts of the margins of the hind wings. Although an arrangement of this kind is seen in
  numerous other butterflies, yet there is perhaps none in which it is carried to quite such a pitch
  of perfection as it is in <i>Morpho</i>, where, on the under surface no part of the body behind
  the posterior legs can <span class="pagenum" id="page349"><span
  class="smaller">{349}</span></span>be seen. There are only about 100 species of Morphides, and 50
  of these are included in <i>Morpho</i>, which is peculiar to tropical and sub-tropical America;
  the other half of the family is divided among ten or twelve genera, found in the Indo-Malay
  region; there being none in Africa. The eastern Morphides, though fine Insects, are not to be
  compared, either in size or brilliancy, with their American allies. The species of <i>Morpho</i>
  are apparently found only in the great forests of South America, where they are far from rare;
  some have a flapping and undulating flight, straight onwards along the alleys of the forest, and
  near the ground; others are never seen except steadily gliding with outstretched wings from 20 to
  100 feet above the ground, where they move across sunny spaces between the crowns of the taller
  trees; the low-flyers settle frequently on the ground to suck the juices from fallen fruit, but
  the members of the other section never descend to the ground. As regards the caterpillars, W.
  M&uuml;ller tells us<a id="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> that the spines they are armed
  with break off, and enter the skin, if the creatures are carelessly handled. Four of the five
  species known to him are conspicuously coloured with black, red, yellow and white. The individuals
  are gregarious. The larvae of <i>M. achilles</i> sit in companies, often of more than 100
  individuals, on trunks of trees, and so form a conspicuous patch. The caterpillars of <i>M.
  epistrophis</i> hang together as red clumps on the twigs of their food-plants. Hence it appears
  that in this genus we have an exception to the rule that night-feeding caterpillars rest in a
  hidden manner during the day.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 5. Brassolides.</b>&mdash;<i>Large butterflies, with the cell of the hind wing
  closed, and usually with a small adjoining prediscoidal cell. Larva not very spiny; thinner at the
  two ends, the tail bifid, the head perpendicular and margined with spines.</i> This small
  sub-family includes less than 100 species arranged in about eight genera, all South American. They
  have the very unusual habit of resting during the day like moths, becoming active only late in the
  afternoon. They are truly noble Insects; although not possessed of the brilliant colours of
  <i>Morpho</i>, they are adorned, especially on the under surface, with intricate lines and shades
  most harmoniously combined, while the upper surface is frequently suffused with blue or purple.
  This sub-family <span class="pagenum" id="page350"><span
  class="smaller">{350}</span></span>attains its highest perfection in the genus <i>Caligo</i>; they
  are enormous Insects, and some of them not rare. The larva of <i>C. eurylochus</i> (Fig. 179)
  during early life is green, and sits on the leaf of a <i>Musa</i>, but after the third moult it
  becomes brown and hides itself among the dry leaves. It is common in the gardens of Rio de
  Janeiro, where its pupae are found on the walls, like those of our white butterflies here.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 6. Acraeides.</b>&mdash;<i>Submedian nervure of fore wings not forked at the base;
  the median without spur. Cells closed. Palpi in section cylindric, sparingly set with hairs. Larva
  armed with branched spines.</i> A somewhat monotonous and uninteresting division; the size is
  moderate or small, and the colours not artistic, but consisting of ill-arranged spots; the under
  side of the hind wings very frequently diversified by numerous line-like marks, radiately
  arranged, and giving place at the base to a few spots. There are about 200 species known, of which
  the majority are African; there are but few Oriental or South American species. Some authorities
  consider there is only one genus, but others prefer to adopt seven or eight divisions.
  <i>Alaena</i> is now placed in Lycaenidae, though until recently it was considered to belong here.
  The females of some species possess an abdominal pouch somewhat similar to that of
  <i>Parnassius</i>.</p>

  <p>The members of this sub-family are considered to be of the protected kind.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 7. Heliconiides.</b>&mdash;<i>Submedian nervure of front wing not forked; median
  with a short spur near the base. Cell of hind wing closed by a perfect nervule. Palpi compressed,
  with scales at the sides, in front covered with hairs. Male with an elongate unjointed, female
  with a four-jointed, front tarsus. Caterpillars set with branched spines.</i> This family is
  peculiar to tropical America and consists of only two genera, <i>Heliconius</i> and
  <i>Eueides</i>, with about 150 species; but it is one of the most characteristic of the South
  American groups of Butterflies. It is very closely allied to the Nymphalides, especially to the
  genera <i>Metamorpha</i> and <i>Colaenis</i>, but is readily distinguished by the perfectly-formed
  nervules that close the wing-cells. The wings are longer and narrower than in Nymphalides, and the
  colour, though exhibiting much diversity, is on the whole similar to that of the heavily-scaled
  forms of Ithomiides of the genera <i>Tithorea</i>, <i>Melinaea</i>, <i>Melanitis</i>; there being
  in several cases a great resemblance between species of the two groups. A frequent feature in one
  group of <i>Heliconius</i> is that the hind wing bears a patch of red prolonged outwards by
  angular radiating marks. The individuals of certain species&mdash;<i>H. melpomene</i> and <i>H.
  rhea</i>&mdash;are known to execute concerted dances, rising and falling in the air like gnats;
  when some of them withdraw from the concert others fill their places. <i>H. erato</i> exhibits the
  very rare condition of trichroism, the hind wings being either red, blue, or green. Schatz states
  that the different forms have been reared from a single brood of larvae. The caterpillars of
  Heliconiides live on Passiflorae, and are said to be very similar to our European
  <i>Argynnis</i>-caterpillars. The chrysalids are very spinous. We may here remark that
  considerable confusion exists in entomological literature in consequence of Ithomiides having been
  formerly included in this sub-family; for remarks formerly made as to "Heliconiides," but that
  really referred only to Ithomiides, have been interpreted as referring to Heliconiides of the
  present system.</p>

  <p>The Heliconiides seem remarkably plastic as regards colour, and are therefore exponents of
  "homoeochromatism." Bates says, as regards them: "In tropical South America a numerous series of
  gaily-coloured butterflies and moths, of very different families, which occur in abundance in
  almost every locality a naturalist may visit, are found all to change their hues and markings
  together, as if by the touch of an enchanter's wand, at <span class="pagenum" id="page352"><span
  class="smaller">{352}</span></span>every few hundred miles, the distances being shorter near the
  eastern slopes of the Andes than nearer the Atlantic. So close is the accord of some half-dozen
  species (of widely different genera) in each change, that he had seen them in large collections
  classed and named respectively as one species."<a id="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a>
  Many of them are believed to be permeated by nauseous fluids, or to possess glands producing
  ill-smelling secretions.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 8. Nymphalides.</b>&mdash;<i>Cells, of both front and hind wing, either closed only
  by imperfect transverse nervules or entirely open. Front tarsus of the male unjointed and without
  spines, of the female four- or five-jointed. Caterpillar either spined or smooth; in the latter
  case the head more or less strongly horned or spined, and the apex of the body bifid.</i> This
  sub-family is specially characterised by the open cells of the wings; the discocellulars, even
  when present, being frequently so imperfect as to escape all but the most careful observation. The
  Nymphalides include upwards of 150 genera and 2000 species. The divisions having smooth larvae are
  separated by Kirby<a id="NtA_220" href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> and others as a distinct
  sub-family (Apaturides). In Britain, as in most other parts of the world, Nymphalides is the
  predominant group of butterflies. We have eighteen species, among which are included the
  Fritillaries, Admirals, Purple Emperor, and the various <i>Vanessa</i>&mdash;Peacock, Camberwell
  Beauty, Red Admiral, Tortoise-shells, and Painted Lady. All have spined caterpillars except the
  Emperor. In the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere Vanessa may be considered the
  dominant butterflies, they being very numerous in individuals, though not in species, and being,
  many of them, in no wise discomfited by the neighbourhood of our own species. Several of them are
  capable of prolonging and interrupting their lives in the winged condition to suit our climate;
  and this in a manner that can scarcely be called hibernation, for they frequently take up the
  position of repose when the weather is still warm, and on the other hand recommence their activity
  in the spring at a very early period. This phenomenon may frequently be noticed in the
  Tortoise-shell butterfly; it is as if the creature knew that however warm it may be in the autumn
  there will be no more growth of food for its young, and that in the spring vegetation <span
  class="pagenum" id="page353"><span class="smaller">{353}</span></span>is sure to be forthcoming
  and abundant before long, although there may be little or none at the time the creature resumes
  its activity. It is probable that the habit may be in some way connected with an imperfect
  activity of the sexual organs. It should, however, be recollected that many larvae of butterflies
  hibernate as young larvae after hatching, and, sometimes, without taking any food. <i>Pyrameis
  cardui</i>, the Painted Lady, is, taking all into consideration, entitled to be considered the
  most ubiquitous of the butterfly tribe. Its distribution is very wide, and is probably still
  extending. The creature is found in enormous numbers in some localities, especially in Northern
  and Eastern Africa; and when its numbers increase greatly, migration takes place, and the Insect
  spreads even to localities where it cannot maintain itself permanently. In Britain it is probably
  during some years nearly or quite absent, but may suddenly appear in large numbers as an
  immigrant. The favourite food of the larva is thistles, but many other plants serve the Insect at
  times.</p>

  <p><i>Vanessa</i>, or <i>Pyrameis</i>,<a id="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a>
  <i>atalanta</i>, the Red Admiral, is common in the Palaearctic and Nearctic regions, and extends
  its range to various outlying spots. The most remarkable of these is the remote Hawaiian Islands,
  where the Insect appears really to be now at home, though it is associated with a larger and more
  powerful congener, <i>P. tameamea</i>. Another interesting Vanessid is <i>Araschnia levana</i>,
  which is peculiar to Europe, where it produces annually two generations so dissimilar to one
  another that they passed current as two species, <i>V. levana</i> and <i>V. prorsa</i>. Although
  intermediate forms are rare in nature they can be induced by certain treatments applied to the
  larvae under human control.</p>

  <p>The dead-leaf butterflies of the genus <i>Kallima</i> belong to Nymphalides. They are so shaped
  and coloured that when settled, with wings closed, on a twig, the appearance is exactly that of a
  dry leaf; the exposed surface is mottled with spots that look just like the patches of minute
  fungi, etc. that are so common on decaying vegetation. The colour and the spots on the under
  surface of this butterfly are very variable. According to Mr. Skertchly,<a id="NtA_222"
  href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> we may presume that in the minute details of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page354"><span class="smaller">{354}</span></span>these resemblances we have a
  case of hypertely similar to that of the resemblance to Insects' minings exhibited by certain
  marks on the tegmina of <i>Pterochroza</i> (mentioned in Vol. V. p. 322).</p>

  <p>In South America there is a somewhat peculiar genus of
  Nymphalides&mdash;<i>Ageronia</i>&mdash;that delights in settling on the trunks of trees rather
  than on flowers or leaves. It was long since noticed that the the species of <i>Ageronia</i> make
  a clicking noise; in some cases when on the wing, in other cases by moving the wings when the
  Insect is settled. The object of the noise is quite uncertain; it has been suggested that it is
  done in rivalry or courtship, or to frighten away enemies. Bigg-Wether found, however, that in
  South Brazil there is a lazy little bird to which this sound serves as a signal, inducing it to
  descend from its perch and eat the clicker. The mode in which the noise is produced is not quite
  clear. Sir George Hampson has pointed out<a id="NtA_223" href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> that
  the fore wing bears at the extreme base a small appendage bearing two hooks, and that two other
  processes on the thorax play on these when the wing moves. His suggestion that these hooks are the
  source of the sound seems highly probable.</p>

  <p>There is a great variety in the larvae of Nymphalides. In the <i>Vanessa</i> group the body is
  armed with spines, each one of which bears shorter thorns, the head being unadorned. The
  Fritillaries (<i>Argynnis</i>, <i>Melitaea</i>) also have caterpillars of this kind. In many other
  forms the head itself is armed with horns or spines of diverse, and frequently remarkable,
  character. In <i>Apatura</i> and its allies the body is without armature, but the head is
  perpendicular, the vertex bifid and more or less prolonged. The caterpillar of our Purple Emperor,
  <i>Apatura iris</i>, is quite unlike any other British caterpillar; in colour it is like a
  Sphingid larva&mdash;green with oblique lateral stripes of yellow and red&mdash;but in form it is
  slug-like, pointed behind, and it has on the head two rather long tentacle-like horns. In the
  South American genus <i>Prepona</i>, the larva of which in general form resembles that of
  <i>Apatura</i> there are no anal claspers, but the extremity of the body is prolonged, forming a
  sort of tail.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Erycinidae</b> (<b>Lemoniidae</b> of some authors).&mdash;<i>The female has six
  perfectly formed legs, though the front pair is smaller. The male has the coxae of the front legs
  forming a spine, and the tarsi unjointed, without claws.</i> This family consists of about 1000
  <span class="pagenum" id="page355"><span class="smaller">{355}</span></span>species, usually of
  rather small size, exhibiting a great variety of shape and coloration, some of them being
  remarkably similar to some of the gay, diurnal moths of South America. The palpi are usually
  small, but in <i>Ourocnemis</i> they are large and porrect. The family is specially characteristic
  of tropical America, but there is one small group of 30 or 40 species, <i>Nemeobiides</i>, in the
  Eastern Hemisphere. We have one species in Britain, <i>Nemeobius lucina</i>, the Duke of Burgundy
  Fritillary. Neither the larvae nor the pupae of Erycinidae present any well-marked characteristic
  feature, but exhibit considerable variety. According to Bar,<a id="NtA_224"
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> some of the larvae are like those of moths; the caterpillar of
  <i>Meliboeus</i> is said to be like that of a <i>Liparis</i>: the chrysalis has the short, rounded
  form of that of the <i>Lycaenidae</i>, and is suspended with the head down, and without a band
  round the body. The larvae of <i>Eurygona</i> are gregarious. The pupae of some other forms
  adhere, heads downwards, to branches. Scudder considers that this family is not distinct from
  Lycaenidae, and that the Central American genus <i>Eumaeus</i> connects the two. Reuter also
  treats Erycinidae as a division of Lycaenidae.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Erycinides.</b>&mdash;[<i>Characters of the family.</i>] <i>Palpi not unusually
  large.</i> We place all the Erycinidae in this sub-family except the following&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Libytheides.</b>&mdash;<i>Butterflies of average size, with the palpi large and
  porrect: the front legs of the male small, the tarsus reduced to one joint: the front leg of the
  female of the normal structure, and but little reduced in size.</i> This division consists of the
  single genus <i>Libythea</i>, with only a score of species. They are Insects somewhat like
  <i>Vanessa</i> in appearance, but cannot fail to be recognised on account of the peculiar palpi.
  The genus is of very wide distribution, occurring in most parts of the warm and temperate
  continental regions, and it also occurs in Mauritius and the Antilles.</p>

  <p>The Libytheides have given rise to much difference of opinion amongst systematists, some of
  whom assign them as a sub-family to the Erycinidae, some to the Nymphalidae; while others treat
  them as a family apart. The families Nymphalidae, Erycinidae and Lycaenidae are so intimately
  allied, that Scudder is probably correct in considering them to form really one huge family; if
  this view were adopted there would be no difficulty <span class="pagenum" id="page356"><span
  class="smaller">{356}</span></span>in locating <i>Libythea</i> therein. If they be kept apart, it
  is almost necessary to separate <i>Libythea</i> also; though possibly its claims to be placed in
  Erycinidae slightly preponderate. The recently described genus <i>Ourocnemis</i> to some extent
  connects Erycinides with Libythaeides.<a id="NtA_225" href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Lycaenidae.</b>&mdash;<i>The front legs but little smaller than the others: in the
  male, however, the tarsus, though elongate, is only of one joint, and is terminated by a single
  claw. No pad on the front tibia. Claws not toothed.</i> The Lycaenidae, or Blues, are, as a rule,
  of small size, but in the tropics there are many that reach the average size of butterflies,
  <i>i.e.</i> something about the stature of the Tortoise-shell butterfly. The family is one of the
  larger of the divisions of butterflies, considerably more than 2000 species being at present
  known, and this number is still rapidly increasing. Although blue on a part of the upper surface
  is a very common feature in the group, it is by no means universal, for there are many "Coppers,"
  as well as yellow and white Lycaenidae. Many species have delicate, flimsy
  appendages&mdash;tails&mdash;to the hind wings, but in many others these are quite absent; and
  there are even tailed and tailless forms of the same species. The members of the group Lipteninae
  (<i>Liptena</i>, <i>Vanessula</i>, <i>Mimacraea</i>, etc.) resemble members of other sub-families
  of Nymphalidae, and even of Pieridae. Lycaenidae are well represented wherever there are
  butterflies; in Britain we have 18 species.</p>

  <p>The larvae of this family are very peculiar, being short, thicker in the middle, and destitute
  of the armature of spines so remarkable in many other caterpillars. It has of late years been
  frequently recorded that some of these larvae are attended by ants, which use their antennae to
  stroke the caterpillars and induce them to yield a fluid of which the ants are fond. Gu&eacute;n&eacute;e had
  previously called attention<a id="NtA_226" href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> to the existence of
  peculiar structures contained in small cavities on the posterior part of the caterpillar of
  <i>Lycaena baetica</i>. These structures can be evaginated, and, it is believed, secrete a fluid;
  Edwards and M&lsquo;Cook are of opinion that they are the source of the matter coveted by the
  ants. The larvae are without spines.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars of the Blues have some of them strange tastes; more than one has been recorded
  as habitually feeding on Aphidae <span class="pagenum" id="page357"><span
  class="smaller">{357}</span></span>and scale-Insects. The pupae are, like the larvae, of short
  inflated form. By a remarkable coincidence, the pupae of two species bear a considerable
  resemblance to the heads of monkeys, or mummies. The Lycaenid pupa is usually extremely
  consolidated, destitute of movement, and is supported&mdash;in addition to the attachment by the
  cremaster&mdash;by a silk thread girdling the middle. There are exceptions to these rules, and
  according to Mr. Robson the pupa of <i>Tajuria diaeus</i> hangs free, suspended from a leaf, and
  can move the body at the spot where the abdominal segments meet the wing-cases in the dorsal
  line.<a id="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Pieridae.</b>&mdash;<i>The six legs well developed, and similar in the sexes; there
  is no pad on the front tibia. The claws of all the feet are bifid, or toothed, and there is an
  empodium.</i> There are upwards of 1000 species of Pieridae already known. Although several
  taxonomists treat the Pieridae and Papilionidae as only subdivisions of one family, yet they
  appear to be quite distinct, and the relationships of the former to be rather with Lycaenidae. In
  Pieridae, white, yellow, and red are the predominant colours, though there is much black also. It
  has recently been ascertained that the yellow and red pigments, as well as the white, are uric
  acid or derivatives therefrom.<a id="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> The physiology
  of this peculiarity has not yet been elucidated, so that we do not know whether it may be
  connected with some state of the Malpighian vessels during metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>Our Garden-White, Brimstone, Clouded-yellows and Orange-tip butterflies belong to this family;
  as does also the South American genus formerly called <i>Leptalis</i>. This generic name, which is
  much mentioned in literature owing to the resemblance of the species of the genus to
  <i>Heliconiides</i>, has now disappeared; <i>Leptalis</i> having been divided into various genera,
  while the name itself is now considered merely a synonym of <i>Dismorphia</i>.</p>

  <p>The African Insect, <i>Pseudopontia paradoxa</i>, has nearly transparent wings, no club to the
  antennae, a remarkably small cell on the wing, and an arrangement of the nervules not found in any
  other butterfly; there being only ten nervules at the periphery of the front wing, and both upper
  and lower radial nervules uniting with the posterior branch of the subcostal. It has been treated
  as a moth by several entomologists. Aurivillius considers that it <span class="pagenum"
  id="page358"><span class="smaller">{358}</span></span>is certainly a butterfly; but as the
  metamorphoses are unknown, we cannot yet form a final opinion as to this curious form. The
  extraordinary Peruvian Insect, <i>Styx infernalis</i>, is also placed in this family by
  Staudinger; it is a small, pale Insect, almost white, and with imperfect scales; a little
  recalling a Satyrid. It appears to be synthetic to Pieridae and Erycinidae.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars of Pieridae are perhaps the least remarkable or attractive of all
  butterfly-caterpillars; their skins are as a rule bare, or covered only with fine, short down or
  hair; their prevalent colour is green, more or less speckled with black and yellow, and they are
  destitute of any prominent peculiarities of external structure. Pupation is accomplished by the
  larva fixing itself to some solid body by the posterior extremity, with the head upwards (or the
  position may be horizontal), and then placing a girdle round the middle of the body. The pupa
  never hangs down freely as it does in Nymphalidae. It has been ascertained by experiment that if
  the girdle round the larva be cut, the pupation can nevertheless be accomplished by a considerable
  proportion of larvae. Some of the pupae are of very peculiar form, as is the case in the
  Orange-tip (Fig. 180, A) and Brimstone butterflies. The Orange-tip butterfly passes nine or ten
  months of each year as a pupa, which is variable in colour; perhaps to some extent in conformity
  with its surroundings. The North American <i>E. genutia</i> has a similar life-history, but the
  larva leaves its Cruciferous food-plant, wanders to an oak tree, and there turns to a pupa,
  resembling in colour the bark of the tree.</p>

  metamorphosis of a well-marked character. The young larva (Fig. 181) is armed with peculiar setae,
  furcate at the tip, each of which bears a tiny ball of fluid. In this stage the caterpillar makes
  scarcely any movement. In the middle of the caterpillar's life a new vestiture appears after an
  ecdysis; numerous fine hairs are present, and the fluid-bearing spines nearly disappear, being
  reduced to a single series of spines of a comparatively small size on each side of the upper
  middle region of the body (Fig. 182). The colour is also a good deal changed, and concomitantly
  there is a much greater voracity and restlessness.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Papilionidae.</b>&mdash;<i>All the legs well developed. Claws large, simple, without

  and in one very important feature&mdash;sexual differentiation&mdash;it certainly is entitled to
  the rank. There are about 700 recorded species, the larger portion of which are included in the
  genus <i>Papilio</i>. The great variety of form has led to this genus being divided; the attempts
  have, however, been partial, with the exception of an arrangement made by Felder, who adopted 75
  sections, and a recent consideration of the subject by Haase, who arranges Felder's sections into
  three sub-genera. Many of the sections have received names, and are treated by some authors as
  genera, so that an unfortunate diversity exists as to the names used for these much-admired
  Insects. The genus is distributed all over the world, but is perhaps nowhere more numerous in
  species than in South America.</p>

  <p>Wallace informs us that the great majority of the species of the Amazon valley frequent the
  shady groves of the virgin forest. In many cases the sexes are extremely different in appearance
  and habits, and are but rarely found together in one spot. The genus <i>Ornithoptera</i> is
  closely allied to <i>Papilio</i>, and contains some of the most remarkable of butterflies, the
  homes of the species being the islands of the Malay Archipelago, and outlying groups of islands,
  there being a smaller number of species in the neighbouring continents. The females are of great
  size, and are so excessively different from their consorts of the other sex, as to arouse in the
  student a feeling of surprise, and a strong desire to fathom the mysteries involved. <span

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page362"><span class="smaller">{362}</span></span></div>

  <p>It would be difficult to surpass the effective coloration of the males in many of the species
  of <i>Ornithoptera</i>; they are, too, very diverse in this respect; <i>O. brookiana</i> is of an
  intense black colour, with a band of angular green marks extending the whole length of its wings,
  while behind the head there is a broad collar of crimson colour. Perhaps the most remarkable of
  all is the <i>O. paradisea</i>, recently discovered in New Guinea; in this species the sexual
  disparity reaches its maximum. The female (Fig. 184) is a large, sombre creature of black, white
  and grey colours, but the male (Fig. 183) is brilliant with gold and green, and is made
  additionally remarkable by a long tail of unusual form on each hind wing.</p>

  <p>We may anticipate that these extraordinary cases of sexual total dissimilarity in appearance
  are accompanied by equally remarkable habits and physiological phenomena. In the case of <i>O.
  brookiana</i> the female is extremely rare, so that the collector, K&uuml;nstler, could only obtain
  fifteen females to a thousand males. According to Mr. Skertchly, instead of the crowd of males
  being eager to compete for the females, the reverse is the case; the female diligently woos the
  male, who exhibits a reluctance to coupling. This observer apparently considered that the "emerald
  feathers" of the male are a guide or incitement to the female.<a id="NtA_229"
  href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In Africa <i>Ornithoptera</i> is to a certain extent represented by two extremely remarkable
  forms, <i>Papilio zalmoxis</i> and <i>P. (Drurya) antimachus</i>. There are about a dozen other
  genera of Papilionidae; most of them contain but few species. <i>Parnassius</i>, however, is rich
  in species inhabiting the mountains and elevated plateaus of the northern hemisphere in both the
  Old and New Worlds; it is remarkable for the small amount of scales on the wings, and for the
  numerous variations of the species. The female possesses a peculiar pouch at the end of the body;
  although only formed during the process of coupling, it has a special and characteristic form in
  most of the species. The curious Indian genus <i>Leptocircus</i> has parts of the front wings
  transparent, while the hind pair form long tails. This genus is of interest in that <span
  class="pagenum" id="page363"><span class="smaller">{363}</span></span>it is said to connect
  Papilionidae to some extent with Hesperiidae. The larvae of this family are remarkable on account
  of a curious process on the thoracic segment called an "osmeterium." It is usually retracted, but
  at the will of the caterpillar can be everted in the form of a long furcate or Y-shaped process;
  there is a gland in the osmeterium, and as a result a strong odour is emitted when the
  exstulpation occurs.</p>

  <p>The pupation of Papilionidae is similar to that of Pieridae, the pupa being placed with the
  head upwards, fixed by the tail, and girt round the middle. A very curious diversity of pupation
  occurs in the genus <i>Thais</i>, in which the pupa is attached by the tail as usual,
  and&mdash;which is quite exceptional&mdash;also by a thread placed at the top of the head. Scudder
  thinks there is also a girdle round the middle, but Dr. Chapman inclines to the view that the
  thread attaching the head is really the median girdle slipped upwards. The pupation of
  <i>Parnassius</i> is exceptional, inasmuch as, like Satyrides, it is terrestrial, in a slight
  construction of silk.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Hesperiidae</b> (<i>Skippers</i>).&mdash;<i>Six perfect legs: metanotum not free,
  largely covered by the mesonotum. A pad on the front tibia. Claws short and thick; empodium
  present.</i> Although this family has been comparatively neglected by entomologists, upwards of
  2000 species and more than 200 genera are known, and it is not improbable that it may prove to be
  as extensive as Nymphalidae. We have already said that Hesperiidae is generally admitted to be the
  most distinct of the butterfly groups. It has been thought by some taxonomists to be allied to
  Papilionidae, but this is a mistake. It is undoubtedly more nearly allied to Heterocera, and when
  the classification of Lepidoptera is more advanced, so that the various natural groups placed in
  that sub-Order are satisfactorily distinguished, it is probable that Hesperiidae will be
  altogether separated from Rhopalocera. We have already mentioned that E. Reuter considers the
  Hesperiidae to be phylogenetically unconnected with Rhopalocera proper; but though quite ready to
  admit that he will probably prove correct in this, we think Lepidopterists will not be willing to
  recognise the family as a sub-Order equivalent in value to all Heterocera.</p>

  <p>The body is shorter and thicker than it is in most butterflies, and is pointed at the tip
  rather than knobbed or bent downwards; the wings are less ample; the antennae are not truly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page364"><span class="smaller">{364}</span></span>knobbed, but are thicker
  before the actual tip, which is itself pointed and more or less bent backwards, so that the
  antennae are somewhat hook-shaped.</p>

  <p>In habits as well as structure the family is markedly distinct from butterflies; the pupation
  is peculiar, and the name Skipper has been applied to the perfect Insects, because so many of them
  indulge in a brief, jerky flight, instead of the prolonged aerial courses characteristic of the
  higher butterflies.</p>

  <p>There is great difference among the members of the family, and some of them possess a very high
  development of the powers of locomotion, with a correspondingly perfect structure of the thoracic
  region, so that, after inspection of these parts, we can quite believe Wallace's statement that
  the larger and strong-bodied kinds are remarkable for the excessive rapidity of their flight,
  which, indeed, he was inclined to consider surpassed that of any other Insects. "The eye cannot
  follow them as they dart past; and the air, forcibly divided, gives out a deep sound louder than
  that produced by the humming-bird itself. If power of wing and rapidity of flight could place them
  in that rank, they should be considered the most highly organised of butterflies." It was probably
  to the genera <i>Pyrrhopyge</i>, <i>Erycides</i>, etc., that Mr. Wallace alluded in the above
  remarks. Although the Hesperiidae are not as a rule beautifully coloured, yet many of these higher
  forms are most tastefully ornamented; parts of the wings, wing-fringes, and even the bodies being
  set with bright but agreeable colours. We mention these facts because it is a fashion to attribute
  a lowly organisation to the family, and to place it as ancestral to other butterflies. Some of
  them have crepuscular habits, but this is also the case with a variety of other Rhopalocera in the
  tropics.</p>

  <p>In their early stages the Skippers&mdash;so far as at present known&mdash;depart considerably
  from the majority of butterflies, inasmuch as they possess in both the larval and pupal instars
  habits of concealment and retirement. The caterpillars have the body nearly bare, thicker in the
  middle, the head free, and more or less notched above. They make much greater use of silk than
  other butterfly-larvae do, and draw together leaves to form caves for concealment, and even make
  webs and galleries. Thus the habits are almost those of the Tortricid moths.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Pupation takes place under similar conditions; and it is interesting to find that
  Chapman considers that the pupa in several points of structure resembles that of the small moths.
  Not only does the larva draw together leaves or stalks to make a shelter for the pupa, but it
  frequently also forms a rudimentary cocoon. These arrangements are, however, very variable, and
  the accounts that have been given indicate that even the same species may exhibit some amount of
  variation in its pupation. Scudder considers that, in the North American Skippers, the cremaster
  is attached to a single Y-like thread. In other cases there is a silk pad on the leaf for the
  cremaster to hook on. An interesting account given by Mr. Dudgeon of the pupation of a common
  Indian Skipper, <i>Badamia exclamationis</i>, shows that this Insect exercises considerable
  ingenuity in the structure of the puparium, and also that the arrangements it adopts facilitate
  one of the acts of pupation most difficult for such pupae as suspend themselves, viz. the hooking
  the cremasters on to the pad above them. <i>Badamia</i> uses a rolled-up leaf (Fig. 185); the
  edges of the leaf are fastened together by silk at <i>d</i>; from this spot there descends a
  thread which, when it reaches the pupa, <i>a</i>, forks so as to form an inverted Y, and is
  fastened to the leaf on either side; the two sides of the leaf are kept together by a cross
  thread, <i>cc</i>. Mr. Dudgeon was fortunate enough to observe the act of pupation, and saw that
  "although the anal prolegs of the larva were attached to a tuft or pad of silk in the usual way,
  and remained so until nearly the whole skin had been shuffled off, yet when the last segment had
  to be taken out, the pupa drew it entirely away from the skin and lifted it over the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page366"><span class="smaller">{366}</span></span>empty skin, and by a series
  of contortions similar to those made by an Insect in depositing an egg, it soon re-attached its
  anal segment or cremaster to the web, throwing away the cast-off skin by wriggling its body
  about."</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series II. Heterocera. Moths.</b></p>

  <p>Although Rhopalocera&mdash;if exclusion be made of the Hesperiidae&mdash;is probably a natural
  group, yet this is not the case with Heterocera. The only definition that can be given of
  Heterocera is the practical one that all Lepidoptera that are not butterflies are Heterocera.
  Numerous divisions of the Heterocera have been long current, but their limits have become more and
  more uncertain, so that at the present time no divisions of greater value than the family command
  a recognition at all general. This is not really a matter of reproach, for it arises from the
  desire to recognise only groups that are capable of satisfactory definition.</p>

  <p>Several attempts have recently been made to form a rough forecast of the future classification
  of moths. Professor Comstock, struck by some peculiarities presented by the Hepialidae,
  Micropterygidae (and Eriocephalidae), recently proposed to separate them from all other
  Lepidoptera as a sub-order Jugatae. Comstock's discrimination in making this separation met with
  general approval. The character on which the group Jugatae is based is, however, comparatively
  trivial, and its possession is not sufficient, as pointed out by Packard,<a id="NtA_230"
  href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> to justify the close association of Hepialidae and
  Micropterygidae, which, in certain important respects, are the most dissimilar of moths. The
  characters possessed by the two families in common may be summarised by saying that the wings and
  wing-bearing segments remain in a low stage of development. In nearly all other characters the two
  families are widely different. Packard has therefore, while accepting Comstock's separation of the
  families in question, proposed a different combination. He considers that Eriocephalidae should be
  separated from all others as "Protolepidoptera" or "Lepidoptera Laciniata," while the whole of the
  other Lepidoptera, comprised under the term "Lepidoptera Haustellata," are divided into
  Palaeolepidoptera (consisting only of Micropterygidae) and Neolepidoptera, comprising all
  Lepidoptera <span class="pagenum" id="page367"><span class="smaller">{367}</span></span>(inclusive
  of Hepialidae) except the Eriocephalidae and Micropterygidae. The question is rendered more
  difficult by the very close relations that exist between Micropterygidae and a sub-Order,
  Trichoptera, of Neuroptera. Dr. Chapman, by a sketch of the classification of pupae,<a
  id="NtA_231" href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> and Dyar, by one on larval stages,<a id="NtA_232"
  href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> have made contributions to the subject; but the knowledge of
  early stages and metamorphosis is so very imperfect that the last two memoirs can be considered
  only as preliminary sketches; as indeed seem to have been the wishes of the authors
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously with the works above alluded to, Mr. Meyrick has given<a id="NtA_233"
  href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> a new classification of the Order. We allude, in other pages,
  to various points in Mr. Meyrick's classification, which is made to appear more revolutionary than
  it really is, in consequence of the radical changes in nomenclature combined with it.</p>

  <p>As regards the various aggregates of families that are widely known in literature by the names
  Bombyces, Sphinges, Noctuae, Geometres, Pyrales, we need only remark that they are still regarded
  as to some extent natural. Their various limits being the subject of discussion and at present
  undecided, the groups are made to appear more uncertain than is really the case. The group that
  has to suffer the greatest changes is the old Bombyces. This series comprises the great majority
  of those moths that have diurnal habits. In it there were also included several groups of moths
  the larvae of which feed in trunks of trees or in the stems of plants, such as Cossidae, that will
  doubtless prove to have but little connection with the forms with which they were formerly
  associated. These groups with aberrant habits are those that give rise to the greatest
  difficulties of the taxonomist.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Castniidae.</b>&mdash;<i>The Insects of this family combine to a large extent the
  characters of butterflies and moths. The antennae are knobbed or hooked at the tip, there is a
  large precostal area to the hind wing. The nervules of the front wing are complex and anastomose
  so as to form one or more accessory cells</i> (Fig. 162). This important, but not extensive,
  family consists chiefly of forms found in tropical America and Australia. The diversity of size,
  form and appearance is very great, and it is probable that the members of the family will be
  separated; indeed, taxonomists are by no means in agreement as to the limits of the family. The
  Castniidae are diurnal Insects, and the North American genus <i>Megathymus</i> is by many
  considered to belong to the Rhopalocera. <i>Euschemon rafflesiae</i> (Fig. 186) is extremely like
  a large Skipper with long antennae, but has a well-marked frenulum. The members of the Australian
  genus <i>Synemon</i> are much smaller, but they also look like Skippers. Their habits are very
  like those of the Hesperiidae; they flit about in the hot sunshine, and when settling after their
  brief flights, the fore wings are spread out at right angles to the body, so as to display the
  more gaily coloured hind wings; at night, or in cloudy weather, the Insect rests on blades of
  grass with the wings erect, meeting vertically over the back, like a butterfly. <i>Hecatesia</i>,
  another Australian genus, is now usually assigned to <i>Agaristidae</i>; its members look like
  moths. The male of <i>H. fenestrata</i> is provided with a sound-producing organ similar to that
  of the Agaristid genus <i>Aegocera</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Castnia</i> of South America are many of them like <span class="pagenum"
  id="page372"><span class="smaller">{372}</span></span>Nymphalid butterflies, but exhibit great
  diversity, and resemble butterflies of several different divisions of the family.<a id="NtA_239"
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The species are apparently great, lovers of heat and can tolerate a very dry atmosphere.<a
  id="NtA_240" href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> The transformations of very few have been
  observed; so far as is known the larvae feed in stems; and somewhat resemble those of Goat-moths
  or Leopard-moths (Cossidae); the caterpillar of <i>C. therapon</i> lives in the stems of Brazilian
  orchids, and as a consequence has been brought to Europe, and the moth there disclosed. The pupae
  are in general structure of the incomplete character, and have transverse rows of spines, as is
  the case with other moths of different families, but having larvae with similar habits.<a
  id="NtA_241" href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> <i>Castnia eudesmia</i> forms a large cocoon of
  fragments of vegetable matter knitted together with silk. These Insects are rare in collections;
  they do not ever appear in numbers, and are generally very difficult to capture.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Neocastniidae.</b>&mdash;The Oriental genus <i>Tascina</i>, formerly placed in
  Castniidae has recently been separated by Sir G. Hampson and associated with <i>Neocastnia
  nicevillei</i>, from East India, to form this family. These Insects have the appearance of
  Nymphalid butterflies. They differ from Castniidae by the want of a proboscis.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Saturniidae.</b>&mdash;This is a large and varied assemblage of moths; the larvae
  construct cocoons; the products of several species being used as silk. These moths have no
  frenulum and no proboscis. The hind wings have a very large shoulder, so that the anterior margin
  or costa stretches far forward beneath the front wing, as it does in butterflies. The antennae of
  the males are strongly bipectinated and frequently attain a magnificent development. The family
  includes some of the largest and most remarkable forms of the Insect-world, <i>Coscinocera
  hercules</i>, inhabiting North Australia, is a huge moth which, with its expanded wings and the
  long tails thereof, covers a space of about 70 square inches. One of the striking features of the
  family is the occurrence in numerous forms of remarkable transparent spaces on the wings; these
  window-like areas usually occur in the middle of the wing and form a most remarkable contrast to
  the rest of the surface, which is very densely <span class="pagenum" id="page373"><span
  class="smaller">{373}</span></span>scaled. In <i>Attacus</i> these attain a large size. In other
  species, such as the South African <i>Ludia delegorguei</i>, there is a small letter-like, or
  symboliform, transparent mark towards the tip of each front wing. We have at present no clue to
  the nature or importance of these remarkable markings. In the genus <i>Automeris</i>, and in other
  forms, instead of transparent spaces there are large and staring ocellate marks or eyes, which are
  concealed when the Insect is reposing. In <i>Arceina</i>, <i>Copiopteryx</i>, <i>Eudaemonia</i>
  and others, the hind wings are prolonged into very long tails, perhaps exceeding in length those
  of any other moths.</p>

  <p>The cocoons are exceedingly various, ranging from a slight open network to a dense elaborate
  structure arranged as in our Emperor moth; in this latter case an opening is left by the larva for
  its exit after it has become a moth, but by an ingenious, chevaux-de-frise work, this opening is
  closed against external enemies, though the structure offers no resistance at all to the escape of
  the moth. Fabre has recorded some observations and experiments which seem to show that the
  instinct predominating over the formation of the cocoon is not cognoscent. The Insect, if
  interfered with, displays a profound stupidity. Its method is blind perseverance in the
  customary.<a id="NtA_242" href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> The cocoon of Saturniidae is more
  often continuous, <i>i.e.</i> entirely closed. Packard says that <span class="pagenum"
  id="page374"><span class="smaller">{374}</span></span><i>Actias luna</i> effects its escape by
  cutting through the strong cocoon with an instrument situate at the base of the front wing. Other
  species were examined and were found to possess the instrument; but Packard is convinced that the
  majority of the species possessing the instrument do not use it, but escape by emitting a fluid
  that softens the cocoon and enables the moth to push itself through.<a id="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> The cocoons of the species of <i>Ceranchia</i> have a
  beautiful appearance, like masses of filagree-work in silver. The pupa in <i>Ceranchia</i> is very
  peculiar, being terminated by a long, spine-like process. In <i>Loepa newara</i> the cocoon is of
  a green colour and suspended by a stalk; looking like the pod, or pitcher, of a plant. The silk of
  the Saturniidae is usually coarse, and is known as Tusser or Tussore<a id="NtA_244"
  href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> silk.</p>

  <p>The larvae of this family are as remarkable as the imagos, being furnished with spine-bearing
  tubercles or warts, or long fleshy processes; the colours are frequently beautiful. The
  caterpillar of <i>Attacus atlas</i> (Fig. 187) is pale olive-green and lavender, and has a
  peculiar, conspicuous, red mark on each flank close to the clasper.</p>

  <p>About seventy genera and several hundred species are already known of this interesting family.
  They are widely distributed on the globe, though there are but few in Australia. Our only British
  species, the Emperor moth, <i>Saturnia pavonia</i>, is by no means rare, and its larva is a
  beautiful object; bright green with conspicuous tubercles of a rosy, or yellow, colour. It affects
  an unusual variety of food-plants, sloe and heather being favourites; the writer has found it at
  Wicken flourishing on the leaves of the yellow water-lily. Although the Emperor moth is one of the
  largest of our native Lepidopterous Insects, it is one of the smallest of the Saturniidae.</p>

  <p>The family Hemileucidae of Packard is included at present in Saturniidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Brahmaeidae.</b>&mdash;The species forming the genus <i>Brahmaea</i> have been
  placed in various families, and are now treated by Hampson as a family apart, distinguished from
  Saturniidae by the presence of a proboscis. They are magnificent, large moths, of sombre colours,
  but with complex patterns on the wings, looking as if intended as designs for <span
  class="pagenum" id="page375"><span class="smaller">{375}</span></span>upholstery. About fifteen
  species are recognised; the geographical distribution is remarkable; consisting of a comparatively
  narrow belt extending across the Old World from Japan to West Africa, including Asia Minor and the
  shores of the Caspian Sea. Little has been recorded as to the life-histories of these Insects. The
  larva is said to have the second and third segments swollen and armed with a pair of lateral
  spines projecting forwards. A cocoon is not formed.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Ceratocampidae.</b>&mdash;This is a small family. They are fine moths peculiar to
  the New World, and known principally by scattered notices in the works of North American
  entomologists. Seven genera and about sixty species are known. The chief genus is
  <i>Citheronia</i>. Some of the larvae are remarkable, being armed with large and complex spines. A
  cocoon is not formed.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Bombycidae.</b>&mdash;In entomological literature this name has a very uncertain
  meaning, as it has been applied to diverse groups; even at present the name is frequently used for
  the Lasiocampidae. We apply it to the inconsiderable family of true silkworm moths. They are
  comparatively small and uninteresting Insects in both the larval and imaginal instars; but the
  cocoons formed by the well-known silkworm are of great value, and some other species form similar
  structures that are of more or less value for commercial purposes. The silkworm has been
  domesticated for an enormous period, and is consequently now very widely spread over the earth's
  surface; opinions differ as to its real home, some thinking it came originally from Northern
  China, while others believe Bengal to have been its native habitat. The silkworm is properly
  called <i>Bombyx mori</i>, but perhaps it is as often styled <i>Sericaria mori</i>. Besides being
  of so great a value in commerce, this Insect has become an important object of investigation as to
  anatomy, physiology and development. Its domestication has probably been accompanied by a certain
  amount of change in habits and instincts, the creature having apparently lost its appreciation of
  freedom and its power of flight; it is also said to be helpless in certain respects when placed on
  trees in the larval state; but the importance of these points has been perhaps somewhat
  exaggerated.<a id="NtA_245" href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although the family Bombycidae is very widely distributed in the warmer regions of the world,
  it includes only 15 or 20 <span class="pagenum" id="page376"><span
  class="smaller">{376}</span></span>genera, and none of them have many species. The Mustiliidae of
  some entomologists are included here. Like the Saturniidae, the Bombycidae are destitute of
  proboscis and of frenulum to the wings, but they possess two or three internal nervures on the
  hind wing instead of the single one existing in Saturniidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Eupterotidae</b> (Striphnopterygidae of Aurivillius).&mdash;This family has only
  recently been separated from Lasiocampidae; its members, however, possess a frenulum; while none
  is present in the larger family mentioned. Its limits are still uncertain, but it includes several
  extremely interesting forms. The larvae of the European processionary moth, <i>Cnethocampa
  processionea</i>, are social in habits; they sometimes occur in very large numbers, and march in
  columns of peculiar form, each band being headed by a leader in front, and the column gradually
  becoming broader. It is thought that the leader spins a thread as he goes on, and that the lateral
  leaders of the succeeding files fasten the threads they spin to that of the first individual, and
  in this way all are brought into unison. The hairs of these caterpillars are abundant, and produce
  great irritation to the skin and mucous membrane of any one unlucky enough to come into too close
  contact with the creatures. This property is, however, not confined to the hairs of the
  processionary moths, but is shared to a greater or less extent by the hairs of various other
  caterpillars of this division of Lepidoptera. In some cases the irritation is believed to be due
  to the form of the hair or spine, which may be barbed or otherwise peculiar in form. It is also
  thought that in some cases a poisonous liquid is contained in the spine.</p>

  <p>The larvae of other forms have the habit of forming dense webs, more or less baglike, for
  common habitation by a great number of caterpillars, and they afterwards spin their cocoons inside
  these receptacles. This has been ascertained to occur in the case of several species of the genus
  <i>Anaphe</i>, as has been described and illustrated by Dr. Fischer,<a id="NtA_246"
  href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> Lord Walsingham,<a id="NtA_247"
  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> and Dr. Holland.<a id="NtA_248"
  href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> The structures are said to be conspicuous objects on trees in
  some parts of Africa. The common dwelling of this kind formed by the caterpillars of <i>Hypsoides
  radama</i> in Madagascar is said to be several feet in length; but the structures of most of the
  other species are of much smaller size.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page377"><span class="smaller">{377}</span></span></div>

  <p>The larvae of the South American genus <i>Palustra</i>, though hairy like other Eupterotid
  caterpillars, are aquatic in their habits, and swim by coiling themselves and making movements of
  extension; the hair on the back is in the form of dense brushes, but at the sides of the body it
  is longer and more remote; when the creatures come to the surface&mdash;which is but
  rarely&mdash;the dorsal brushes are quite dry, while the lateral hairs are wet. The stigmata are
  extremely small, and the mode of respiration is not fully known. It was noticed that when taken
  out of the water, and walking in the open air, these caterpillars have but little power of
  maintaining their equilibrium. They pupate beneath the water in a singular manner: a first one
  having formed its cocoon, others come successively and add theirs to it so as to form a mass.<a
  id="NtA_249" href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> Another species of <i>Palustra</i>, <i>P.
  burmeisteri</i>, Berg,<a id="NtA_250" href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> is also believed to
  breathe by means of air entangled in its long clothing; it comes to the surface occasionally, to
  renew the supply; the hairs of the shorter brushes are each swollen at the extremity, but whether
  this may be in connexion with respiration is not known. This species pupates out of the water,
  between the leaves of plants.</p>

  <p><i>Dirphia tarquinia</i> is remarkable on account of the great difference of colour and
  appearance in the two sexes. In the Australian genus <i>Marane</i> the abdomen is densely tufted
  at the extremity with hair of a different colour.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Perophoridae.</b>&mdash;The moths of the genus <i>Perophora</i> have for long been
  an enigma to systematists, and have been placed as abnormal members of Psychidae or of Drepanidae,
  but Packard now treats them as a distinct family. The larvae display no signs of any social
  instincts, but, on the contrary, each one forms a little dwelling for itself. Some twenty species
  of <i>Perophora</i> are now known; they inhabit a large part of the New World, extending from
  Minnesota to Buenos Aires. The habits of <i>P. melsheimeri</i> have been described by Harris,
  Packard<a id="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> and Newman, and those of <i>P.
  batesi</i> by Newman.<a id="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> The larva is very
  peculiar; there is a flexible pair of appendages on the <span class="pagenum" id="page378"><span
  class="smaller">{378}</span></span>head, the use of which is unknown;<a id="NtA_253"
  href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> they arise by slender stalks behind and above the eyes, are
  about as long as the head, and are easily broken off. After hatching, the young larva, when it
  begins to feed, fastens two leaves together with silk threads, and so feeds after the fashion of a
  Tortricid, rather than a case-making, larva. Subsequently, however, the caterpillar entirely
  detaches two pieces of leaves and fastens them together at the edges, thus constructing a case
  that it lives in, and carries about; it can readily leave the case and afterwards return to it.
  When at rest, the larva relieves itself from the effort of supporting this case by the device of
  fastening it to a leaf with a few silken threads; when the creature wished to start again, "it
  came out and bit off these threads close to the case." Subsequently it changes inside the case to
  a pupa armed with transverse rows of teeth, like so many other pupae that are capable of a certain
  amount of movement. The larva is of broad, short, peculiar form, and is said to be very bold in
  defending itself when attacked. The moth is somewhat like the silkworm moth, though of a more
  tawny colour. Newman does not allude to any cephalic appendages as existing in the larva of <i>P.
  batesi</i>. If we accept the eggs figured and described by Snellen,<a id="NtA_254"
  href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> as those of <i>P. batesi</i>, it is possible that this Insect
  possesses a peculiar mode of oviposition, the eggs being placed one on the other, so as to form an
  outstanding string; but we think this example probably abnormal; the mode is not shared by <i>P.
  melsheimeri</i>. The genus <i>Lacosoma</i> is considered by Packard to be an ally of
  <i>Perophora</i>. The caterpillar of <i>L. chiridota</i> doubles a leaf at the mid-rib and fastens
  the two edges together, thus forming an unsymmetrical case. Many larvae of Microlepidoptera do
  something like this, but the <i>Lacosoma</i> cuts off the habitation thus formed and carries it
  about. Packard says it may have descended from ancestors with ordinary habits and that certain
  peculiar obsolete markings on the body of the caterpillar may be indications of this.<a

  <p>The Argentinian Insect <i>Mamillo curtisea</i><a id="NtA_256"
  href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> is also probably an ally of <i>Lacosoma</i>. The caterpillar
  of this moth spins a dwelling for itself, and is remarkable from the bright colour of the thoracic
  segments, the following somites being colourless; the head bears a pair of large processes, quite
  different from those figured by Harris. The moth itself is very Geometrid-like in colour and form.
  This species is now assigned to <i>Perophora</i>, but it seems to be very doubtful whether many of
  the species placed in this genus really belong to it. The diversity of habits and instincts
  evinced by these moths of exceptional modes of life, but considered to be closely allied, is very
  interesting. The most remarkable of all is the Hammock-moth, <i>Perophora sanguinolenta</i>, of
  the centre of South America, the larva of which constructs its portable habitations out of its own
  <span class="pagenum" id="page380"><span class="smaller">{380}</span></span>excrement, which is of

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Sphingidae</b> (<i>Hawk-moths</i>).&mdash;A very important family of moths of large
  or moderate size. They have a proboscis which is frequently very long; there is a frenulum; the
  body is stouter than in most other Lepidoptera, and the wings are of small superficies in
  comparison with it; the antennae are somewhat peculiar, having a thick, solid appearance, pointed
  at the tip. This is usually somewhat hooked, and bears a few hairs. In the males the antennae are
  formed in a manner specially characteristic of the family. In section, each joint shows a
  chitinous process on the under side (Fig. 189, A), forming with that of the other joints a
  continuous ridge, and on each side of this ridge there exists a series of short, delicate "cilia"
  arranged in a very beautiful manner (Fig. 189, B). This structure, with some modifications,
  appears to be usually present in the family; it attains a very perfect development in cases where
  the tips of two rows of cilia bend towards one another, meeting so as to form an arched cavity.
  This structure is different from what occurs in the males of other families of Lepidoptera, for
  though cilia are very common, they are usually placed either on two projections from the body of
  the antennae (instead of on the two sides of a single projection), or there is but a single whorl,
  or set, of them on each joint (<i>Catocala</i>, etc.). The front wings are usually pointed at the
  tip, and are long in proportion to their width; but in the Smerinthini they are of different form,
  with the outer margin scalloped; the hind wings are remarkably small; the abdomen is frequently
  pointed, but in the Macroglossini, or Humming-bird hawk-moths, it is furnished at the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page381"><span class="smaller">{381}</span></span>tip with a tuft, or with two
  tufts, of dense, long scales, capable of expansion.</p>

  <p>The larvae are remarkable for their colours and form. The anterior segments are attenuated, but
  are capable of great retraction, so that in repose (Fig. 190, A) this shape is concealed by the
  curious attitudes that are assumed. There is in nearly all cases a conspicuous horn on the
  eleventh segment, and the body at the extremity behind the horn is so much modified that the
  terminal two segments look like little more than a pair of large claspers. In the Choerocampini,
  the thoracic segments are retractile, and can be withdrawn into the more or less inflated fourth
  segment, and give the creature somewhat the appearance of a miniature hooded snake. The larvae of
  Sphingidae do not bear any conspicuous hairs&mdash;except during the first instar. They do not
  spin cocoons, but bury themselves in the earth. The pupa is remarkable from the deep cleft that
  exists to admit air to the first spiracle, and for a deep depression on each side of the anterior
  part of abdominal segments 5-7; in some cases the proboscis projects on the breast somewhat like
  the handle of a pitcher.</p>

  <p>A great deal has been written on the colours, markings, and attitudes of Sphingid larvae, and
  many interesting facts have been brought to light. We may refer the reader to the writings of
  Weismann<a id="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> and Poulton,<a id="NtA_259"
  href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> without, however, recommending him to place an implicit
  confidence in their somewhat metaphysical disquisitions; for the views there shadowed will <span
  class="pagenum" id="page382"><span class="smaller">{382}</span></span>necessarily became much
  modified with the advance of exact knowledge. It is certain that the position assumed by the same
  individual varies much according to age, and to the interval since the last moult; sometimes the
  attitude is much more remarkable than that shown in Figure 190, A, for the anterior segments are
  held erect, as well as contracted, the front part of the body being curled, and the Insect
  supported by the claspers and two pairs only of the abdominal feet. There is, too, a considerable
  difference in colour before and after an ecdysis. Piepers, who has had a long experience among
  Sphingid larvae in Java, considers that much of what has been written as to the protective value
  of their colours and attitudes, is mere fancy, and wild generalisation.<a id="NtA_260"
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sphingidae have been recorded as capable of producing sounds in the larval and pupal, as well
  as in the perfect, instars; but the method in which this is done has not been ascertained, except
  in the case of the imago of the Death's-head moth, which is well known to emit a very audible cry
  when not on the wing; in this case it is highly probable that the method is the friction of the
  palpi against the proboscis, as stated by R&eacute;aumur and Landois; the inner face of the palp is said
  to be marked in this case with fine ridges or striae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Cocytiidae.</b>&mdash;A single genus constitutes this family, and there are only
  three or four species known; they come from the region of New Guinea, whence the first was brought
  by D'Urville nearly a hundred years ago.  They are still amongst <span class="pagenum"
  id="page383"><span class="smaller">{383}</span></span>the rarest of Insects. Nothing is known as
  to their life-histories. In appearance they somewhat remind us of the Bee-hawk moths and
  Zygaenidae. Butler says<a id="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> the family is
  characterised by the palpi, which differ much in the two sexes, and by the antennae resembling
  those of Castniidae or Hesperiidae. The form, transparency, and coloration of the wings reminds
  one vividly of the Sphingid genus <i>Hemaris</i>; the nervuration is somewhat like that of

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Notodontidae</b> (<i>Prominents</i>, <i>Puss-moths</i>, etc.).&mdash;This is one of
  the most extensive of the families of Bombyces; it consists in larger part of obscure-coloured
  moths, somewhat like the ordinary Noctuidae of temperate regions; to which family the Notodonts
  are indeed considered to be very closely allied. The family contains, however, some very
  remarkable forms. <i>Tarsolepis</i> has an elongate body, terminated (in the female of <i>T.
  fulgurifera</i>) by a very conspicuous tuft of enormously long, battledore scales; while in the
  male of <i>T. sommeri</i> the hind legs are provided with an appendage of beautiful, roseate
  hairs. A few of the larger kinds bear a considerable resemblance in form and proportions to the
  Sphingidae. Some of the larvae are most interesting objects; the Puss-moth caterpillar, the
  Lobster, and the Dragon larvae are of such strange forms that they have already interested several
  generations of observers. The Puss-moth is common in the southern half of England; its caterpillar
  (Fig. 192) has, instead of the claspers, a pair of tubes in which are concealed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page384"><span class="smaller">{384}</span></span>two long, flexible whips,
  capable of being thrust out, and withdrawn, with rapidity. The structure and the mode of action of
  these flagella have been well elucidated by Professor Poulton.<a id="NtA_262"
  href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> The flagella are to be considered as actual prolongations of
  the receptacle in which each is placed, though they are of very different texture therefrom; they
  are everted by blood-pressure and drawn in by muscular action; this latter function is very
  perfectly accomplished, the amount of relaxation and contraction of the muscle being very great.
  It has been maintained that the whips have arisen as arms of protection against the attacks of
  Ichneumon flies; observation shows, however, that the proportion of these "protected" Insects
  destroyed by enemies of this sort is quite as large as it is in the case of forms that are not so
  protected. The Puss-moth larva is also believed to be protected by terrifying attitudes,<a
  id="NtA_263" href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> as well as by ejection (like so many other larvae
  and insects generally) of fluid. There is no reason for believing that these larvae are less eaten
  than others, and consequently a further hypothesis has been proposed, to the effect that if they
  had not acquired these means of defence they would have been exterminated altogether. This
  supposition is considered to account for their acquiring the defence by means of natural
  selection; realising the dictum of D. O'Phace, Esq.&mdash;</p>

  <p>When the Puss-moth caterpillar is full grown it spins a peculiar cocoon of a solid and
  impervious nature, which it manages to make look very like the spots, crevices, or other places
  amongst which it is located; in this prison the creature remains for nine or ten months&mdash;by
  far the larger part of its existence. When it has changed to a moth it has to escape from the cell
  in which it so effectually confined itself. This is effected by the cocoon being thinner in front
  of the head of the moth, and by the emission from the alimentary canal of a fluid that softens the
  cocoon at the spot alluded to. Mr. Latter has ascertained<a id="NtA_264"
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> that this fluid is strongly alkaline, and contains potassium
  hydroxide. The front of the head of the moth is provided with a shield, consisting of a portion of
  the pupa shell, which enables the moth to <span class="pagenum" id="page385"><span
  class="smaller">{385}</span></span>push through in safety, and at the same time protects the head
  from the emitted fluid. Figure 192 shows the great change that occurs in the period of a few hours
  in the size of the head of the larva, as well as in that of the spiracles: in A the old spiracles
  are seen surrounded by the much larger new orifices, which are at the moment of moulting quite
  visible through the skin that is about to be cast off.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar of the Lobster-moth, <i>Stauropus fagi</i>, is more remarkable than that of the
  Puss-moth, but is unfortunately very rare. It has remarkably long thoracic legs, the abdomen is
  swollen at the tip, and instead of the terminal claspers has two long slender processes. The
  effect of these peculiarities is greatly enhanced by the extraordinary attitude assumed by the
  caterpillar, which holds the first five segments erect, with the second and third pairs of
  thoracic legs outstretched; the swollen terminal segment is also held erect. Hermann M&uuml;ller
  states<a id="NtA_265" href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> that when seen from the front this
  caterpillar looks like a spider, and also that when alarmed it moves the long legs after the
  fashion of an Arachnid. He believes that it is thus effectually protected from the attacks of
  Ichneumons. Birchall says<a id="NtA_266" href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> that the young larva,
  when at rest, closely resembles, in colour and outline, one of the twigs of beech with unopened
  buds, on which it frequently stations itself; and that, when feeding, its likeness to a great
  earwig or to a <i>Staphylinus</i> is very striking. Others say that this caterpillar resembles a
  dead and crumpled beech leaf.</p>

  <p>The larva of <i>Hybocampa milhauseri</i>&mdash;the Dragon of old Sepp&mdash;is highly
  remarkable. When young it has grand lateral horns in front, and a dorsal row; as it grows the
  lateral horns disappear. Dr. Chapman says<a id="NtA_267" href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> that
  he could not understand at first why any larva should have such remarkable angular outlines,
  curiously conspicuous corners and humps. But he afterwards found that the creature exactly
  resembled a curled oak leaf, eaten and abandoned by a <i>Tortrix</i> larva. This caterpillar also
  constructs an elaborate cocoon from which the moth escapes by an operation performed by the pupa,
  which is provided with two hard spines, called by Dr. Chapman sardine-openers. "By a lateral
  rotatory movement of the pupa, which obtains its fulcrum <span class="pagenum" id="page386"><span
  class="smaller">{386}</span></span>from the tightness with which it is grasped by the cocoon, it
  traverses over and over again" the same part of the cocoon till it is cut through; at the same
  time the spines act as guides to a fluid which is emitted so as to soften the part that has to be
  sundered.</p>

  <p>Though many other larvae of Notodontidae are of most curious form and assume remarkable
  attitudes, yet this is not the case with all, and some are quite ordinary and like the
  caterpillars of common Noctuidae. This is the case with the species <i>Rhegmatophila alpina</i> we
  have selected to illustrate the metamorphosis of the Order (Fig. 157). Those who wish to form an
  idea of the variety of larval forms in this family will do well to refer to Packard's beautiful
  volume on the North American forms.<a id="NtA_268" href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> The family
  has a very wide distribution, but is absent from New Zealand and Polynesia, and appears to be but
  poorly represented in Australia. In Britain we have about two dozen species.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 12. Cymatophoridae.</b>&mdash;A small family of nocturnal moths that connect the
  Bombyces with the Noctuids; they are usually associated with the latter, but are widely separated
  in Hampson's arrangement because of a slight difference of nervuration, nervule 5 being nearer to
  6 than to 4, whereas in Noctuidae the reverse is the case. The Insects, however, in certain
  respects approach the Notodontidae, and are of interest if only as showing that the linear
  sequences we adopt in books are necessarily conventional, and to some extent deceptive. We have
  three genera in Britain; our pretty Peach-blossom, <i>Thyatira batis</i>, and the very different
  Buff-arches, <i>T. derasa</i>, being among them. Meyrick denies any connexion of this group with
  Noctuidae, and in his nomenclature <i>Cymatophora</i> becomes <i>Polyploca</i>, and the family,
  consequently, Polyplocidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. Sesiidae</b> or <b>Aegeriidae</b> (<i>Clear-wings</i>).&mdash;A family of
  comparatively small extent; its members have frequently one or both pairs of wings in large part
  free from scales, the tip of the body tufted, the hind legs of one sex peculiar. The size is
  usually small, but in the largest forms the measurement may be but little less than two inches
  across the expanded wings. The pupa is of the kind classed as "incompletae" by Chapman, the
  appendages not being firmly glued to the body, and much <span class="pagenum" id="page387"><span
  class="smaller">{387}</span></span>mobility existing; an "eye-collar" is present, and the segments
  of the abdomen are armed with series of teeth. The larva is a concealed feeder, nearly naked and
  colourless, but with the legs normal in number&mdash;three thoracic, four abdominal pairs of feet,
  and the terminal claspers; these are sometimes but poorly developed; the larvae have a greater or
  less resemblance to those of Longicorn beetles, the habits of which they share. The family was
  formerly associated with the Sphingidae, with which it has no true relationship; it is more
  closely allied to the Tineidae. Some of the species have a certain resemblance to Hymenoptera,
  which is probably in most, if not in all cases merely incidental. The proper position of the
  family was pointed out by Butler,<a id="NtA_269" href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> but he did
  not distinguish it from Tinaegeriidae. Meyrick calls the family Aegeriadae, and places it in his
  series Tineina.</p>

  <p>We have two genera of these Clear-wings in Britain. They are <i>Trochilium</i> (called
  variously <i>Sesia</i>, <i>Sphecia</i>, and <i>Aegeria</i>), with two species of comparatively
  large size, and <i>Sesia</i> (called variously <i>Trochilium</i> and <i>Aegeria</i>), with nearly
  a dozen species of smaller size. A third genus, <i>Sciapteron</i>, is doubtfully native with us.
  They are much prized by collectors on account of the rarity of the Insects and their great
  difference in appearance from our other native Lepidoptera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Tinaegeriidae.</b> This is one of the least known of the families of Lepidoptera,
  and has only recently been distinguished from Sesiidae. It is entirely exotic, and our knowledge
  of it is principally due to Lord Walsingham.<a id="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>
  Nothing is known as to the life-histories, except that it has been stated by Stainton that a larva
  feeds in webs on shoots of a shrub of the genus <i>Clerodendron</i>. The family is widely
  distributed, but its metropolis will probably prove to be the tropics of Africa. It is of
  considerable interest as showing that the Sesiidae really <span class="pagenum" id="page388"><span
  class="smaller">{388}</span></span>belong to the Tineid series of moths. The species we figure
  (Fig. 193) has a character otherwise peculiar to Sesiidae in the wings being inserted on the
  thorax remote from the head&mdash;a feature we do not find in the Tineidae proper; while on the
  other hand it has the long wing-fringes, and the shape of the wings that are characteristic of
  Tineidae. It is worth mentioning that though these Insects are of excessive rarity and very
  peculiar, there exists in the Solomon Islands<a id="NtA_271" href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a> a
  species distinct from, though at first sight excessively similar to, the S. African one we
  figure.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 15. Syntomidae.</b>&mdash;This family has usually been associated with the Zygaenidae.
  It includes a large number of moths having, as a rule, in external appearance little to
  distinguish them from the family named. Many of them are of gaudy colours, and probably of
  diurnal, but somewhat sedentary, habits. The wings are less ample than usual, the hind pair
  frequently very small, so that the Insects have somewhat the proportions of Hymenoptera. In some
  cases the resemblance is made more remarkable by the fact that the wings are transparent and bare
  of scales, or have scales only at the margins, so as to be like the wings of Hymenoptera. Not less
  remarkable is the fact that these Insects use the body itself for the purposes of adornment or
  display; thus adopting a system prevalent in the Hymenoptera, rather than that of their own Order,
  where the rule is that the wings are more ornamented than the body. In many cases the shape of the
  body is so very different from the normal that the disposition of the organs of life in the
  interior of the body must be materially affected. In some genera, such as <i>Andrenimorpha</i>,
  the form, colour and attitude of the body and some of the limbs are plainly similar to
  Hymenoptera. These Insects have a highly-developed frenulum, retinaculum, and proboscis;
  bipectinate antennae in the male, a complex organ at the base of the abdomen on each side, and are
  in fact highly-developed forms, except perhaps as regards the structures in connexion with
  flight.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately little or nothing is known as to the habits and metamorphoses of these
  extraordinary creatures, but it is no doubt to them Seitz referred in saying, "How far one may be
  deceived by appearances of a mimetic nature can only be comprehended by visiting the tropics; in
  this part of the world <span class="pagenum" id="page389"><span
  class="smaller">{389}</span></span>[Europe] one is prepared by knowledge gained from books for the
  appearance <i>Sesia</i> presents. Had one no knowledge of this sort as to Sesiidae he would
  actually in the field [in Brazil] overlook dozens of these little creatures without being aware of
  his deception. The surprise at finding a quite different being in the net from what one believes
  he has caught occurs daily in Brazil, so rich in Lepidoptera."<a id="NtA_272"
  href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> The same intelligent observer says<a id="NtA_273"
  href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a> that a species of <i>Macrocneme</i> was observed by him to be
  exactly like one of the blue wasps of the genus <i>Pepsis</i>.</p>

  <p>One remarkable point in these Hymenopteroid Syntomids is their complete dissimilarity from
  their immediate allies. They resemble very different Hymenoptera; and not only stinging
  Hymenoptera; the Sessiliventres have a large share of their attentions; the numerous species of
  <i>Dycladia</i> partaking the appearance of the South American Sawflies in a wonderful manner.
  Bees, Wasps of the most different kinds, and a variety of Sawflies are beautifully paralleled, if
  one may use such an expression, by these Syntomids. That shown in Fig. 194 has the abdomen formed
  like that of a Petiolate Hymenopteron; the base of this part, moreover, resembles in a remarkable
  manner the "median segment" of that Order. The constriction is, however, placed not at the base of
  the abdomen but beyond the second segment. Thus the structure is not morphologically similar to
  that of the Hymenoptera, for the median segment of Aculeate Hymenoptera consists of only one
  abdominal segment, while in this moth the corresponding part is formed of two segments. Though
  anatomically inexact, the resemblance is, as to proportions, correct; and those who delight in the
  use of the imagination will see that had the moth used only one segment for the imitation, the
  result would have been less successful owing to insufficient size. In his very interesting account
  of some Brazilian Syntomids,<a id="NtA_274" href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> Seitz describes a
  species of <i>Trichura</i> provided with a long appendage that is held straight backwards during
  life; and he informs us that this creature resembles a female Ichneumon, the long process looking
  like the elongate ovipositor of the Hymenopteron. Possibly the species from Demerara we figure may
  resemble an Ichneumon we are not acquainted with, though its colour and form rather suggest a
  likeness to an Aculeate. <span class="pagenum" id="page390"><span
  class="smaller">{390}</span></span>This case of resemblance is of the most noteworthy character,
  for an appendage of this kind in a Lepidopterous Insect is without parallel, and is almost
  equivalent to the production of a new structure. An interesting feature of the case is that
  Ichneumonidae do not sting, and there is no evident reason why the enemies of the moth should be
  particularly afraid of an ovipositor.</p>

  <p>The larvae appear to be in form somewhat like those of Zygaenidae; but with the same sort of
  remarkable clothing, in the form of tufts and brushes, that we find in Lymantriidae. A cocoon is
  formed. In Britain no member of this family is to be met with, but <i>Naclia ancilla</i> may
  formerly have been a native; <i>Syntomis phegea</i> has occurred here; probably an escaped example
  that had been introduced in one of its earlier stages.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 16. Zygaenidae</b> (<i>Burnet-Moths</i>).&mdash;This family is one about the limits and
  characters of which much difference of opinion prevails. As exemplified by our Burnet-moths it is
  characterised (in addition to the points given in the table) by the peculiar, flexible antennae;
  these are a little thicker before the tip, but are curved and pointed at the extremity, and
  without pectinations in the male. There is an elongate proboscis; bladder-like organs at the sides
  of the first abdominal segment are not present. The pupa is softer than is usual in the
  Macrolepidoptera, and the parts are less firmly fixed together, so that unusual mobility exists;
  six of the intersegmental membranes <span class="pagenum" id="page391"><span
  class="smaller">{391}</span></span>are free, and the abdomen has much power of movement; there is
  no eye-collar; the antennae, hind legs, and proboscis-tips stretch backwards as far as the fifth
  or sixth abdominal segment, the tips being quite free; on the dorsal plates of the abdomen there
  are rows of minute elevations reminding one of the teeth existing in pupae that live in stems or
  galleries. This is altogether a peculiar pupa; it lives closely enclosed in a small hard cocoon,
  and its great capacity for movement is perhaps connected with the fact that the pupa itself
  manages to force its way through the cocoon in anticipation of the emergence of the moth. This
  cocoon is fastened tightly to a stem, and is covered with a substance that gives it a glazed
  appearance. The larvae are objects of a baggy nature, with inferior coloration, consisting of
  large dark blotches on a light ground, and without any remarkable development of their somewhat
  feeble system of hairs. Numerous small moths from the tropics are assigned to the family; they are
  most of them conspicuously marked and coloured, and like our Burnets are probably diurnal.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The family Chalcosiidae is reduced by Hampson to the position of a sub-family of Zygaenidae. It
  consists of a large variety of diurnal moths of varied and brilliant colours, with an expanse of
  wing large in comparison with the typical Zygaenae, and with the antennae pectinate or flabellate
  to the tip. Some of these Insects (which are as conspicuous as possible in appearance, at any rate
  in a cabinet, the East Indian <i>Cadphises moorei</i> <i>e.g.</i>) are considered to be destitute
  of any special "protection." <i>Histia</i> is a genus of remarkable cruciform moths, of a mixture
  of black and metallic colours, with carmine-tinted bodies. <i>Hampsonia pulcherrima</i> (East
  India) is a curious moth of butterfly form and coloration, red and black with yellow patches, and
  with some of the nervules distorted, as if they had been forced apart in certain spots in order to
  accommodate these patches.</p>

  <p>Two or three hundred species of Chalcosiidae are recorded. They are specially characteristic of
  the Indo-Malayan region.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page392"><span class="smaller">{392}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 17. Himantopteridae</b> (<b>Thymaridae</b> of some authorities) are placed by Hampson
  in the sub-family Phaudinae of Zygaenidae characterised by the absence of the mouth-parts. The
  Himantopteridae are small moths, and have the scales on the wings very imperfect and hair-like;
  the hind wings form long slender tails, so that the Insects scarcely look like moths. They are
  peculiar to India and Africa. In the South African genus <i>Dianeura</i> (belonging really to
  Phaudinae) also the wings are scaleless and nearly transparent.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 18. Heterogynidae.</b>&mdash;Consists of the single genus <i>Heterogynis</i> which has
  hitherto been found only in the south of Europe. This is an important form connecting Zygaenidae
  and Psychidae. The larvae resemble those of Zygaena, and construct an oval cocoon for their
  metamorphosis. The male issues as a small moth of smoky colour, the scales being but imperfect;
  the female chrysalis shows no trace of any appendages, and the imago is practically a maggot, and
  never leaves the cocoon; in it she deposits her eggs, and the young larvae hatch there.<a
  id="NtA_275" href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 19. Psychidae.</b>&mdash;Small, or moderate-sized moths, with imperfect scales, and
  little or no colour beyond certain shades of duskiness; the sexes very different, the female being
  wingless and sometimes quite maggot-like; the male often with remarkable, bipectinate antennae,
  the branches sometimes very long and flexible. Larva inhabiting a case that it carries about. This
  family consists of Insects unattractive in appearance but presenting some points of great
  interest. It is frequently stated that the Psychidae are destitute of scales, but Heylaerts
  states<a id="NtA_276" href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> that, in addition to hairs, scales of a
  more or less imperfect formation are present in all, but that they are, like those of some
  Sphingidae (<i>Macroglossa</i>), very easily detached. There is much difference in the females,
  some having well-developed legs, while others are not only apterous, but are bare and destitute of
  appendages like a maggot, while in certain cases (Fig. 196, G), the head is reduced in size and is
  of peculiar form so as to make the Insect look really like the larva of one of the parasitic
  Diptera. These females never leave their cases, but deposit their eggs <span class="pagenum"
  id="page393"><span class="smaller">{393}</span></span>therein, and inside, also, their former
  pupa-skin; and here the young hatch; the peculiar little larvae are very numerous, and it is
  suggested that they make a first meal on the body of their parent, but this we believe has not
  been satisfactorily ascertained. Great differences as to the condition of the legs, antennae,
  etc., are said to exist in species of the same genus. There is also a remarkable diversity in the
  pupae of the females; the male sex being normal in this respect. Some of the female pupae are
  destitute of wing-sheaths and all other appendages, while others are said to possess them, though
  there are no wings at all in the imago (<i>Fumea</i>, <i>e.g.</i>).<a id="NtA_277"
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> Great difficulties attend the study of these case-bearing
  Insects, and several points require careful reconsideration, amongst them the one we have just
  mentioned. The males fly rapidly in a wild manner, and may sometimes be met with in swarms; their
  lives are believed to be very brief, rarely exceeding a couple of days, and sometimes being
  limited to a few hours.</p>

  <p>The larvae are called basket-worms, and their baskets or cases are well worthy of attention.
  Their variety is remarkable; the most extraordinary are some of the genus <i>Apterona</i> Fig.
  197, B, which perfectly resemble the shells of Molluscs such as snails; indeed, the specimens in
  the collection at the British Museum were sent there as shells. This case is not, like those of
  other Psychidae, constructed of earth or vegetable matter, but is of silk and is in texture and
  appearance exactly <span class="pagenum" id="page394"><span
  class="smaller">{394}</span></span>like the surface of a shell.  <i>Psyche helix</i> is, according
  to Ingenitzky,<a id="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> found in great numbers near Lake
  Issyk-kul in Central Asia, where the larvae feed, in their snail-shell-like cases, on a grass,
  just like snails. Only females could be reared from these larvae. The case of <i>Chalia
  hockingi</i> (Fig. 197, C) consists of little pieces of wood cut to the proper lengths, and
  spirally arranged, so as to form a construction that would be quite a credit to our own species.
  In some of the Canephorinae we meet with long cylindrical cases, like those of Caddis-worms, or of
  Tineid larvae.</p>

  <p>Riley has given an account of several points in the structure and natural history of one of the
  North American basket- or bag-worms, <i>Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis</i>; one of his points being
  the manner in which the newly hatched larva forms its case.<a id="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> This question has also been discussed by Packard.<a
  id="NtA_280" href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> The larvae when hatched in unnatural conditions
  will make use of fragments of paper, cork, etc., for the case; the act of construction takes one
  or two hours, and the larva does not eat till the case is completed. It walks in a peculiar
  manner, the legs of the third pair being moved forwards together, as if they were the prongs of a
  fork.</p>

  <p>This family is already one of considerable extent, but its study, as already remarked, is but
  little advanced. Some naturalists are inclined to place it among the Tineidae, but it is connected
  with Zygaenidae by means of Heterogynidae. Mr. Meyrick divides it, placing <i>Psyche</i> and
  <i>Sterrhopteryx</i> (the forms representing, according to his ideas, the family Psychidae in
  Britain) in the series Psychina which includes Zygaenidae. He <span class="pagenum"
  id="page395"><span class="smaller">{395}</span></span>removes the other British genera,
  <i>Fumea</i>, and <i>Epichnopteryx</i>, to Tineidae near <i>Solenobia</i> and <i>Taleporia</i>.
  The group Canephorinae, to which the two genera in question belong, was long since separated from
  Psychidae by Herrich-Sch&auml;ffer, but this course was condemned by Heylaerts. Parthenogenesis has
  been thought by some to occur in numerous species in this family, but Heylaerts says that it is
  limited to <i>Apterona crenulella</i> var. <i>helix</i>, and even of this species males are found
  in certain localities.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 20. Cossidae</b> (<i>Goat-Moths</i>, or <i>Carpenter-Worms</i>).&mdash;Moths of
  moderate, or rather large size, without proboscis, frequently with a dense covering of matted,
  imperfect scales; the pattern being vague. The larvae bore into trees in which they often make
  large burrows, leaving holes from which sap exudes. Our common Goat-moth is a good specimen of
  this family, which is a very widely distributed one. The Australian genus <i>Ptilomacra</i> has
  very large, pectinated antennae in the male. The larvae of Cossidae are nearly bare of clothing
  and are unadorned; they form a slight cocoon of silk mixed with gnawed wood. The pupa of the
  Goat-moth is remarkable for the great development of the rows of teeth on the dorsal aspects of
  the segments of the abdomen, and for the absence of consolidation in this part, six of the
  intersegmental incisions being free, and the ventral aspect almost membranous. Very little is
  known as to other pupae of the family. It is believed that the generations of these Insects are
  fewer than usual, the growth of the larva occupying a period of two or three years. The larva of
  <i>Zeuzera aesculi</i> forms a temporary cocoon in which it passes a winter-sleep, before again
  feeding in the spring.<a id="NtA_281" href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> It is a moot question
  whether the Zeuzeridae should be separated from the Cossidae or not. The group includes our
  Wood-leopard moth, which, like many other Zeuzerids, is spotted in a very striking but inartistic
  manner. The position the family Cossidae should occupy in an arrangement of the Lepidoptera is a
  very difficult question. Some consider the Insects to be allied to Tortricidae. The
  wing-nervuration of <i>Cossus</i> is very peculiar and complex, there being four or five cells on
  the front wing, and three on the hind one. Meyrick places Zeuzeridae as a family of his series
  Psychina, but separates Cossidae proper (he calls them Trypanidae) as a family of the series

  <p><b>Fam. 21. Arbelidae.</b>&mdash;Closely allied to Cossidae, but without frenulum, and with
  less complex wing-nervures. A small family believed to be similar to Cossidae in the life-history.
  The tropical African Arbelidae are considered by Karsch to be a distinct family, Hollandiidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 22. Chrysopolomidae.</b>&mdash;This family has been established by Dr. Aurivillius<a
  id="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> for an African genus, allied in wing-nervuration
  to Cossidae; the Insects are like Lasiocampidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 23. Hepialidae</b> (<i>Ghost-</i> and <i>Swift-Moths</i>).&mdash;Moths of very diverse
  size, some gigantic; wings not fitting together well at the bases; without a frenulum; no
  proboscis; the scales imperfect; the nervures complex. The Hepialidae are extremely isolated
  amongst the Lepidoptera; indeed, they have really no allies; the conclusion that they are
  connected with the Micropterygidae being certainly erroneous. Although but small in
  numbers&mdash;only about 150 species being known&mdash;they exhibit a remarkable variety in size
  and colour. Many are small obscure moths, while others are of gigantic size&mdash;six or seven
  inches across the wings&mdash;and are amongst the most remarkably coloured of existing Insects.
  The great <i>Charagia</i> of Australia, with colours of green and rose, bearing white spots, are
  remarkable. The South African <i>Leto venus</i> is of large size, and has an astonishing supply of
  glittering metallic splashes on the wings, making a barbaric but effective display. The South
  Australian <i>Zelotypia staceyi</i>, of enormous size, is also a handsome moth; but the majority
  of species of the family are adorned only in the feeblest manner.</p>

  <p>Very little is known as to the larvae; they are either subterranean, feeding on roots, or they
  live in the wood of trees and shrubs. They are nearly bare, and are apparently the lowest type of
  Bombycid larva. At the same time, it would appear there is considerable variety amongst them.
  Packard says<a id="NtA_283" href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> the young larva of <i>Hepialus
  mustelinus</i> has the arrangement of setae that is normal in Tineidae. The larva of <i>H.
  humuli</i> seems to be a very simple form, but <i>H. hectus</i> shows a considerable amount of
  divergence from it. They probably live for several years; the larva of <i>H.
  argenteo-maculatus</i> in North America lives for three years, at first eating the roots of Alder
  and then entering the <span class="pagenum" id="page397"><span
  class="smaller">{397}</span></span>stems. The pupae are also peculiar. They are of unusually
  elongate, cylindrical form, with comparatively feeble integument, but with a considerable
  development of chitinous, elevated, toothed ridges, on the dorsal aspect, and a very strong ridge
  of this kind on the ventral surface of the seventh segment; the wing-sheaths are short; it is very
  difficult to distinguish the full number of abdominal segments. These pupae are remarkably agile,
  and by wriggling and kicking are able to move a considerable distance; it is said that they can
  force themselves to the surface even when the superficial soil is quite hard. We cannot consider
  this pupa naturally placed amongst either the pupae obtectae or incompletae of Chapman.</p>

  <p>We have already remarked that little is known as to the life-histories. The species are
  probably prolific, a female of <i>H. thule</i> having been known to deposit more than 2000 eggs.
  Of the Australian forms little more is known<a id="NtA_284" href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>
  than that they live in the wood of trees and shrubs, and are rapidly disappearing; we may fear
  that some are extinct without ever having been discovered, and others, also unknown but still
  existing, may disappear only too soon; the wasteful destruction of timber in Australia having been
  deplorable.</p>

  <p>The peculiar habits of the Hepialidae are not likely to bring the Insects to the net of the
  ordinary collector, and we believe they never fly to light, hence it is probable that we are
  acquainted with only a small portion of the existing species; their distribution is very wide, but
  Australia seems to be their metropolis, and in New Zealand twelve species are known. The genera as
  at present accepted are remarkable for their wide distribution. <i>Leto</i> is said to occur in
  South Africa and in the <span class="pagenum" id="page398"><span
  class="smaller">{398}</span></span>Fiji Islands; but we must repeat that the study of these
  interesting Insects is in a very primitive state, and our present knowledge of their distribution
  may be somewhat misleading.</p>

  <p>The habits of the European <i>Hepialus</i> in courtship have been observed to a considerable
  extent and are of great interest, an astonishing variety and a profound distinction in the methods
  by which the sexes are brought together having been revealed.</p>

  <p><i>H. humuli</i>, our Ghost-moth, is the most peculiar. Its habits were detected by Dr.
  Chapman.<a id="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> The male is an Insect of exceptional
  colour, being white above, in consequence of a dense formation of imperfect scales; the female is
  of the brownish tints usual in Swift-moths. In the month of June the male selects a spot where he
  is conspicuous, and hovers persistently there for a period of about twenty minutes in the
  twilight; his colour has a silvery-white, glistening appearance, so that the Insect is really
  conspicuous notwithstanding the advanced hour. Females may be detected hovering in a somewhat
  similar manner, but are not conspicuous like the male, their colour being obscure; while so
  hovering they are ovipositing, dropping the eggs amongst the grass. Females that have not been
  fertilised move very differently and dash about in an erratic manner till they see a male; they
  apparently have no better means of informing the hovering male of their presence than by buzzing
  near, or colliding with him. Immediately this is done, the male abandons his hovering, and
  coupling occurs. There can be little doubt that the colour of the male attracts the female; but
  there is a variety, <i>hethlandica</i>, of the former sex coloured much like the female, and in
  some localities varieties of this sort are very prevalent, though in others the species is quite
  constant. This variation in the colour of the males is very great in Shetland,<a id="NtA_286"
  href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> some being quite like the females. In <i>H. hectus</i> the two
  sexes are inconspicuously and similarly coloured. The male hovers in the afternoon or evening in a
  protected spot, and while doing so diffuses an agreeable odour&mdash;said by Barrett to be like
  pine-apple&mdash;and this brings the female to him, much in the same manner as the colour of <i>H.
  humuli</i> brings its female. The hind legs of the male <span class="pagenum" id="page399"><span
  class="smaller">{399}</span></span>are swollen, being filled with glands for secreting the odorous
  matter.<a id="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> This structure has led to the
  suggestion of the generic name <i>Phymatopus</i> for the Insect. Turning to other species of the
  genus, we find that the normal relative r&ocirc;les of the sexes are exhibited, but with considerable
  diversity in the species. In <i>H. lupulinus</i> the males fly about with rapidity, while the
  female sits on a stem and vibrates her wings; she thus attracts the males, but they do not
  perceive her unless happening to come within three or four feet, when they become aware of her
  proximity, search for and find her. It is doubtful whether the attraction is in this case the
  result of an odour; it would appear more probable that it may be sound, or that the vibration of
  the wings may be felt by the male.</p>

  <p>In <i>H. sylvinus</i>, <i>H. velleda</i> and <i>H. pyrenaicus</i> less abnormal modes of
  attracting the males occur, the individuals of this latter sex assembling in great numbers at a
  spot where there is a female. In the first of the three species mentioned the female sits in the
  twilight on the stem of some plant and vibrates the wings with rapidity; she does not fly; indeed,
  according to Mr. Robson, she does not till after fertilisation move from the spot where she
  emerged. In <i>H. pyrenaicus</i> the female is quite apterous, but is very attractive to the
  males, which as we have said, assemble in large numbers near her. Thus within the limits of these
  few allied forms we find radically different relations of the sexes.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>1. The male attracts the female&mdash;(A) by sight (<i>H. humuli</i>); (B) by odour (<i>H.
    hectus</i>).</p>
    <p class="sp0">2. The female attracts the male&mdash;(A) by vibration of wings (<i>H.
    lupulinus</i> and <i>H. sylvinus</i>); (B) without vibration, but by some means acting at a
    distance (<i>H. velleda</i>, <i>H. pyrenaicus</i>).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Little or nothing is known as to the habits of the great majority of the more remarkable forms
  of the family. The gigantic Australian forms are believed to be scarcely ever seen on the
  wing.</p>

  <p>The Hepialidae differ from other Lepidoptera by very important anatomical characters. The
  absence of most of the <span class="pagenum" id="page400"><span
  class="smaller">{400}</span></span>mouth-parts is a character common to them and several other
  divisions of Lepidoptera; but the labial palpi are peculiarly formed in this family, being short
  and the greater portion of their length consisting of an undivided base, which probably represents
  some part of the labium that is membranous in normal Lepidoptera. The thoracic segments are
  remarkably simple, the three differing less from one another than usual, and both meso- and
  meta-notum being much less infolded and co-ordinated. The wings are remarkable for the similarity
  of the nervuration of the front and hind wings, and by the cell being divided by longitudinal
  nervules so as to form three or four cells. On the inner margin of the front wing there is near
  the base an incision marking off a small prominent lobe, the jugum of Prof. Comstock. Brandt
  mentions the following anatomical peculiarities,<a id="NtA_288"
  href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> viz. the anterior part of the alimentary canal is
  comparatively simple; the respiratory system is in some points like that of the larva; the heart
  is composed of eight chambers; the appendicular glands of the female genitalia are wanting. The
  testes remain separate organs throughout life. The chain of nerve ganglia consists of the supra-
  and infra-oesophageal, three thoracic, and five abdominal, ganglia, while other Lepidoptera have
  four abdominal.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 24. Callidulidae.</b>&mdash;A small family of light-bodied diurnal moths having a great
  resemblance to butterflies. In some the frenulum is present in a very rudimentary condition, and
  in others it is apparently absent. <i>Cleosiris</i> and <i>Pterodecta</i> are very like
  butterflies of the Lycaenid genus <i>Thecla</i>. Although fifty species and seven or eight genera
  are known, we are quite ignorant of the metamorphoses. Most of the species are found in the
  islands of the Malay Archipelago, but there are a few in East India.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 25. Drepanidae</b> (or <b>Drepanulidae</b>). (<i>Hook-tips</i>).&mdash;The larger moths
  of this family are of moderate size; many of the species have the apex of the front wing pointed
  or even hooked; some have very much the appearance of Geometrid moths; they resemble very
  different members of that family. <i>Oreta hyalodisca</i> is remarkable on account of the very
  large, transparent patch on each front wing, though the other species of the genus have nothing of
  the sort. In the genus <i>Deroca</i> we <span class="pagenum" id="page401"><span
  class="smaller">{401}</span></span>find Insects with the scales imperfect, they being few and
  small and approximating in form to hairs; in <i>D. hyalina</i> scales are nearly entirely absent.
  In other genera, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Peridrepana</i>, <i>Streptoperas</i>, there is only a very
  inferior state of scale-formation. The few larvae that are known are peculiar; they are nearly
  bare of hair, without the pair of terminal claspers, while the body is terminated by a long
  tubular process. They form a slight cocoon among leaves.</p>

  <p>The members of the family were formerly much misunderstood, and were assigned to various
  positions in the Order. There are now about 30 genera, and 150 species known, the geographical
  distribution of the family being very wide. In Britain we have half a dozen species. <i>Cilix
  glaucata</i> (better known as <i>C. spinula</i>) is said "to undoubtedly imitate" the excrement of
  birds. No doubt the Insect resembles that substance so as to be readily mistaken for it. This
  Insect has a very wide distribution in North America, Europe and East India, and is said to vary
  so much in the structure of its organs as to justify us in saying that the one species belongs to
  two or three genera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 26. Limacodidae</b> (or <b>Eucleidae</b>).&mdash;These are somewhat small moths, of
  stout formation, sometimes very short in the body, and with rather small wing-area. The family
  includes however at present many Insects of diverse appearance; there are numerous forms in which
  apple-green is a prominent colour; some bear a certain resemblance to the Swifts, others to
  Noctuids; some, <i>Rosema</i> and <i>Staetherinia</i>, are of extraordinary shapes; certain very
  small forms, <i>Gavara</i>, <i>Ceratonema</i>, resemble Tortricids or Tineids; a few even remind
  one of Insects of other Orders; so that the group is a mimetic one. <i>Nagoda nigricans</i>
  (Ceylon) has the male somewhat like a Psychid, while the female has a different system of
  coloration and wing-form. In <i>Scopelodes</i> the palpi are in both sexes remarkable; elongated,
  stiff, directed upwards and brush-like at the tip. Altogether there are about 100 genera and 400
  species known; the distribution of the family is very wide <span class="pagenum"
  id="page402"><span class="smaller">{402}</span></span>in both hemispheres, but these Insects do
  not occur in insular faunas. In Britain we have two genera, <i>Heterogenea</i> and <i>Apoda</i>
  (better known as <i>Limacodes</i><a id="NtA_289" href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a>), each with a
  single species.</p>

      magnified. (After Chapman.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The early stages of these Insects are of great interest. The eggs, so far as known, are
  peculiar flat oval scales, of irregular outline and transparent; we have figured an example in
  Vol. V. Fig. 83. The eggs of the same moth are said to vary much in size, though the larvae that
  emerge from them differ little from one another in this respect. The latter are peculiar, inasmuch
  as they have no abdominal feet, and the thoracic legs are but small; hence the caterpillars move
  in an imperceptible gliding manner that has suggested for some of them the name of slug-worms. The
  metamorphoses of a few are known. They may be arranged in two groups; one in which the larva is
  spinose or armed with a series of projections and appendages persisting throughout life; while in
  the members of the second group the spines have only a temporary existence. At the moment the
  young larva of <i>Apoda testudo</i> emerges from the egg it has no conspicuous spines or
  processes, and is an extremely soft, colourless creature,<a id="NtA_290"
  href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> but it almost immediately displays a remarkable system of
  complex spines. These really exist in the larva when it is hatched, and are thrust out from pits,
  as explained by Dr. Chapman. In the succeeding stages, the spines become modified in form, and the
  colour of the body and the nature of <span class="pagenum" id="page403"><span
  class="smaller">{403}</span></span>the integument are much changed, so that in the adult larva
  (Fig. 199) the spines have subsided into the condition of mere prominences, different in colour
  from the rest of the surface. These larvae appear to be destitute of a head, but there really
  exists a large one which is retracted, except during feeding, into the body; the five pairs of
  abdominal feet of the larvae of allied families are replaced by sucker-like structures on the
  first eight abdominal segments. The spinneret of the mouth is not a pointed tubular organ, but is
  fish-tailed in shape, and hence disposes the silky matter, that aids the larva in moving on the
  leaves, in the form of a ribbon instead of that of a thread. It has been stated that these
  peculiar larvae "imitate" the coloured galls frequently found on the leaves of trees. The North
  American forms of this family have very varied and most extraordinary larvae.<a id="NtA_291"
  href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> In the pretty and conspicuous larva of <i>Empretia
  stimulea</i>, the tubercles or processes of the body are, in the later stages, armed with hairs,
  that contain a poisonous or irritating fluid, said to be secreted by glands at the bases of the
  processes. These hairs are readily detached and enter the skin of persons handling the
  caterpillars. The larva of the North American Hag-moth, <i>Phobetron pithecium</i>, is a curious
  object, bearing long, fleshy appendages covered with down. Hubbard makes the following statement
  as to the instincts of this larva:<a id="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a>&mdash;"The
  hag-moth larvae do not seek to hide away their cocoons, but attach them to leaves and twigs fully
  exposed to view, with, however, such artful management as to surroundings and harmonising colours
  that they are of all the group the most difficult to discover. A device to which this Insect
  frequently resorts exhibits the extreme of instinctive sagacity. If the caterpillar cannot find at
  hand a suitable place in which to weave its cocoon, it frequently makes for itself more
  satisfactory surroundings by killing the leaves, upon which, after they have become dry and brown
  in colour, it places its cocoon. Several of these caterpillars unite together, and selecting a
  long and vigorous immature shoot or leader of the orange tree, they kill it by cutting into its
  base until it wilts and bends over. The leaves of a young shoot in drying turn a light tan-color,
  which <span class="pagenum" id="page404"><span class="smaller">{404}</span></span>harmonises most
  perfectly with the hairy locks of the caterpillar covering the cocoon. The latter is,
  consequently, not easily detected, even when placed upon the exposed and upturned surface of the
  leaf."</p>

  <p>The cocoons of Limacodidae are unusually elaborate, the larva forming a perfect lid in order to
  permit itself to escape when a moth. Chapman states that the larva lies unchanged in the cocoon
  all winter, moulting to a pupa in the spring, and that the pupa escapes from the cocoon previous
  to the emergence of the moth.<a id="NtA_293" href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> Both Chapman and
  Packard look on the family as really nearer to Microlepidoptera than to Bombyces; Meyrick (calling
  it Heterogeneidae) places it at the end of his series Psychina next Zygaenidae.</p>

  <p>We may allude here to the little moths, described by Westwood under the name of
  <i>Epipyrops</i>,<a id="NtA_294" href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> that have the extraordinary
  habit of living on the bodies of live Homopterous Insects of the family Fulgoridae in India. What
  their nutriment may be is not known. The larva exudes a white flocculent matter, which becomes a
  considerable mass, in the midst of which the caterpillar changes to a pupa. Westwood placed the
  Insect in Arctiidae; Sir George Hampson suggests it may be a Limacodid, and this appears
  probable.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 27. Megalopygidae</b> (or <b>Lagoidae</b>).&mdash;The American genera,
  <i>Megalopyge</i> and <i>Lagoa</i>, are treated by Berg and by Packard<a id="NtA_295"
  href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> as a distinct family intermediate between Saturniidae and
  Limacodidae. The larva is said by the latter authority to have seven pairs of abdominal feet
  instead of five pairs&mdash;the usual number in Lepidoptera. When young the caterpillars of
  <i>Lagoa opercularis</i> are white and resemble a flock of cotton wool. When full grown the larva
  presents the singular appearance of a lock of hair, moving in a gliding, slug-like manner. Under
  the long silky hair there are short, stiff, poison-hairs. The larva forms a cocoon, fitted with a
  hinged trap-door for the escape of the future moth. This curious larva is destroyed by both
  Dipterous and Hymenopterous parasites.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 28. Thyrididae.</b>&mdash;A small family of Pyraloid moths, exhibiting considerable
  variety of form and colour, frequently with hyaline patches on the wings. They are mostly small
  <span class="pagenum" id="page405"><span class="smaller">{405}</span></span>Insects, and contain
  no very striking forms. Some of them look like Geometrids of various groups. The family is widely
  distributed in the tropical zone, and includes 25 genera, of which <i>Rhodoneura</i>, with upwards
  of 100 species, is the chief one. The larvae are said to be similar to those of Pyralidae. This
  family is considered by Hampson and Meyrick to be ancestral to butterflies.<a id="NtA_296"

  <p><b>Fam. 29. Lasiocampidae</b> (<i>Eggers</i>, <i>Lappet-moths</i>). Usually large Insects
  densely covered with scales, without frenulum, but with the costal area of the hind wing largely
  developed, and the male antennae beautifully pectinate, Lasiocampids are easily recognised. They
  are well known in Britain, though we have but few species. The flight of some of the species is
  powerful, but ill-directed, and the males especially, dash about as if their flight were quite
  undirected; as indeed it probably is. The difference in the flight of the two sexes is great in
  some species. In the genus <i>Suana</i> and its allies we meet with moths in which the difference
  in size of the two sexes is extreme; the males may be but 1&frac12; inches across the wings, while the
  very heavy females may have three times as great an expanse. Kirby separates these Insects to form
  the family Pinaridae; it includes the Madagascar silkworm, <i>Borocera madagascariensis</i>. The
  African genus <i>Hilbrides</i> is remarkable for the wings being destitute of scales, and
  consequently transparent, and for being of very slender form like a butterfly. The eggs of
  Lasiocampidae are smooth, in certain cases spotted in an irregular manner like birds' eggs.
  Sometimes the parent covers them with hair. The larvae are clothed with a soft, woolly hair, as
  well as with a shorter and stiffer kind, neither beautifully arranged nor highly coloured, and
  thus differing from the caterpillars of Lymantriidae; this hair in some cases has very irritating
  properties. Cocoons of a close and compact nature are formed, and hairs from the body are
  frequently mixed with the cocoon. In <span class="pagenum" id="page406"><span
  class="smaller">{406}</span></span>some species the walls of the cocoons have a firm appearance,
  looking very like egg-shell&mdash;a fact which is supposed to have given rise to the name of
  Eggers. Professors Poulton and Meldola have informed us that this appearance is produced by
  spreading calcium oxalate on a slight framework of silk, the substance in question being a product
  of the Malpighian tubes.<a id="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> In various families of
  Lepidoptera it happens that occasionally the pupa exists longer than usual before the appearance
  of the perfect Insect, and in certain members of this family&mdash;notoriously in <i>Poecilocampa
  populi</i>, the December moth&mdash;this interval may be prolonged for several years. There is not
  at present any explanation of this fact. It may be of interest to mention the following
  case:&mdash;From a batch of about 100 eggs deposited by one moth, in the year 1891 (the Puss-Moth
  of the family Notodontidae), some sixty or seventy cocoons were obtained, the feeding up of all
  the larvae having been effected within fourteen days of one another; fourteen of the Insects
  emerged as moths in 1892; about the same number in 1893; in 1894, twenty-five; and in 1895, eleven
  emerged. Lasiocampidae is a large family, consisting of some 100 genera and 500 or more species,
  and is widely distributed. It is unfortunately styled Bombycidae by some naturalists.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 30. Endromidae.</b>&mdash;The "Kentish glory," <i>Endromis versicolor</i>, forms this
  family; it is a large and strong moth, and flies wildly in the daytime in birch-woods. The larva
  has but few hairs, and is said when young to assume a peculiar position, similar to that of
  saw-fly larvae, by bending the head and thorax backwards over the rest of the body.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 31. Pterothysanidae.</b>&mdash;Consists of the curious East Indian genus
  <i>Pterothysanus</i>, in which the inner margins of the hind wings are fringed with long hairs.
  They are moths of slender build, with large wing-expanse, black and white in colour, like
  Geometrids. There is no frenulum. Metamorphoses unknown.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 32. Lymantriidae.</b>&mdash;(Better known as <b>Liparidae</b>). These are mostly small
  or moderate-sized moths, without brilliant colours; white, black, grey and brown being
  predominant; with highly-developed, pectinated antennae in the male. The larva is very hairy, and
  usually bears tufts or brushes of shorter hairs, <span class="pagenum" id="page407"><span
  class="smaller">{407}</span></span>together with others much longer and softer, these being
  sometimes also amalgamated to form pencils; the coloration of these larvae is in many cases very
  conspicuous, the tufts and pencils being of vivid and strongly contrasted colours. Some of these
  hairy larvae are poisonous. A cocoon, in which much hair is mixed, is formed. The pupae are
  remarkable, inasmuch as they too are frequently hairy, a very unusual condition in Lepidoptera.
  The Lymantriidae is one of the largest families of the old group Bombyces; it includes some 180
  genera and 800 species, and is largely represented in Australia. <i>Dasychira rossii</i> is found
  in the Arctic regions. In Britain we have eight genera represented by eleven species; the
  Gold-tails, Brown-tails and Vapourer-moths being our commonest Bombyces, and the latter being
  specially fond of the London squares and gardens, where its beautiful larva may be observed on the
  leaves of roses. Most of the Lymantriidae are nocturnal, but the male Vapourer-moth flies in the
  daytime. In this family there are various species whose females have the wings small and unfit for
  flight, the Insects being very sluggish, and their bodies very heavy. This is the state of the
  female of the Vapourer-moth. The males in these cases are generally remarkably active, and very
  rapid on the wing.</p>

  <p>Some of these moths increase in numbers to an enormous extent, and commit great ravages.
  <i>Psilura monacha</i>&mdash;the Nun, "die Nonne" of the Germans,<a id="NtA_298"
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a>&mdash;is one of the principal troubles of the conservators of
  forests in Germany, and great sums of money are expended in combating it; all sorts of means for
  repressing it, including its infection by fungi, have been tried in vain. The caterpillars are,
  however, very subject to a fungoid disease, communicated by natural means. It is believed, too,
  that its continuance in any locality is checked after a time by a change in the ratio of the two
  sexes. It is not a prolific moth, for it lays only about 100 eggs, but it has been shown that
  after making allowance for the numerous individuals destroyed by various enemies, the produce of
  one moth amounts in five generations to between four and five million individuals. The larva feeds
  on Coniferae, and on many leafy trees and shrubs. The young <span class="pagenum"
  id="page408"><span class="smaller">{408}</span></span>larva is provided with two sets of setae,
  one set consisting of very long hairs, the other of setae radiating from warts; each one of this
  second set of spines has a small bladder in the middle, and it has been suggested that these
  assist in the dissemination of the young caterpillars by atmospheric means.<a id="NtA_299"
  href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> These aerostatic setae exist only in the young larva. The
  markings of the moth are very variable; melanism is very common both in the larva and imago; it
  has been shown conclusively that these variations are not connected, as black larvae do not give a
  larger proportion of black moths than light-coloured caterpillars do. In England this moth is
  never injurious. A closely allied form, <i>Ocneria dispar</i>, was introduced by an accident into
  North America from Europe about thirty years ago; for twenty years after its introduction it did
  no harm, and attracted but little attention; it has, however, now increased so much in certain
  districts that large sums of money have been expended in attempting its extirpation.</p>

  <p><i>Dasychira pudibunda</i> has occasionally increased locally to an enormous extent, but in the
  limited forests of Alsace the evil was cured by the fact that the caterpillars, having eaten up
  all the foliage, then died of starvation.<a id="NtA_300" href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a>
  <i>Teara melanosticta</i> is said to produce columns of processionary caterpillars in
  Australia.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 33. Hypsidae</b> (or <b>Aganaidae</b>).&mdash;A family of comparatively small extent,
  confined to the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the Eastern hemisphere. The colours are
  frequently buff and grey, with white streaks on the outer parts of the wings. We have nothing very
  like them in the European fauna, our species of <i>Spilosoma</i> are perhaps the nearest approach.
  In <i>Euplocia</i> the male has a pouch that can be unfolded in front of the costa at the base of
  the anterior wing; it is filled with very long, peculiar, hair-like scales growing from the costal
  margin; both sexes have on each side of the second abdominal segment a small, projecting structure
  that may be a sense-organ. The female is more gaily coloured than the male.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 34. Arctiidae.</b>&mdash;With the addition recently made to it of the formerly separate
  family Lithosiidae, Arctiidae has become the most extensive family of the old Bombycid series of
  moths, comprising something like 500 genera and 3000 species. Hampson recognises four
  sub-families&mdash;Arctiinae, Lithosiinae, <span class="pagenum" id="page409"><span
  class="smaller">{409}</span></span>Nolinae, Nycteolinae,&mdash;to which may be added others from
  America&mdash;Pericopinae, Dioptinae, Ctenuchinae; these sub-families being treated as families by
  various authors. The sub-family Arctiinae includes our Tiger- and Ermine-moths, and a great many
  exotic forms of very diverse colours and patterns; the species of this division are, on the whole,
  probably more variable in colour and markings than in any other group of Lepidoptera. There are
  many cases of great difference of the sexes; in the South American genus <i>Ambryllis</i> the male
  is remarkable for its hyaline wings with a few spots; while the female is densely scaled, and very
  variegate in colour. There are some cases (the South European genus <i>Ocnogyna</i>) where the
  female is wingless and moves but little, while the male flies with great rapidity. <i>Epicausis
  smithi</i>, from Madagascar, one of the most remarkable of moths, is placed in this division of
  Arctiidae; it is of a tawny colour, variegate with black; the abdomen of this latter colour is
  terminated by a large tuft of long scarlet hairs; the Insect has somewhat the appearance of a
  Hummingbird-hawkmoth. <i>Ecpantheria</i> is an extensive genus of tropical American moths (having
  one or two species in North America), of black and white or grey colours, with very complex
  markings; the male in some species has a part of the hind wing produced as a tail, or lobe, of a
  different colour.</p>

  <p>The sub-family Pericopinae are almost peculiar to South America (two species of
  <i>Gnophaela</i> exist in North America); some of this sub-family bear a great resemblance to
  Heliconiid butterflies.</p>

  <p>The Dioptinae are likewise American moths of diurnal habits, and many of them bear a striking
  resemblance to the Ithomiid butterflies they associate with when alive.</p>

  <p>The sub-family Lithosiinae is of great extent; our native "Footmen" give a very good idea of
  it; the moths are generally of light structure, with long, narrow front wings; a simple system of
  yellow and black colour is of frequent occurrence. Many of this group feed in the larval state on
  lichens. Hampson includes in this group the Nyctemeridae&mdash;light-bodied diurnal moths, almost
  exclusively of black and white colours, of Geometrid form, frequently treated as a distinct
  family.</p>

  <p>The sub-family Nolinae is a small group of rather insignificant Insects, in appearance like
  Pyralids or Geometrids; four or five <span class="pagenum" id="page410"><span
  class="smaller">{410}</span></span>species are native in Britain. Packard maintains the family
  Nolidae as distinct.<a id="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The sub-family Nycteolinae consists of a few small moths the position of which has always been
  uncertain; <i>Nycteola</i> (better known as <i>Sarrothripus</i>), <i>Halias</i>, and <i>Earias</i>
  are all British genera that have been placed amongst Tortrices, to which they bear a considerable
  resemblance. <i>Sarrothripus</i> is at present placed by Hampson in Noctuidae, by others in
  Lithosiidae, by Meyrick in Arctiidae. The sub-family forms the family Cymbidae of Kirby;<a
  id="NtA_302" href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> it includes at present only about 70 species, all
  belonging to the Eastern hemisphere. Two types of larvae are known in it: one bare, living exposed
  on leaves; the other, <i>Earias</i>, hairy, living among rolled-up leaves. <i>Halias prasinana</i>
  is known from the testimony of numerous auditors to produce a sound when on the wing, but the
  <i>modus operandi</i> has not been satisfactorily ascertained. Sound-production seems to be of
  more frequent occurrence in Arctiidae than it is in any other family of Lepidoptera;
  <i>Dionychopus niveus</i> produces a sound by, it is believed, friction of the wings. In the case
  of the genera <i>Setina</i> and <i>Chelonia</i> the process is said to be peculiar to the male
  sex: Laboulb&egrave;ne believes it to proceed from drum-like vesicles situate one on each side of the
  base of the metathorax.<a id="NtA_303" href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 35. Agaristidae.</b>&mdash;An interesting assemblage of moths, many of them diurnal and
  of vivid colours, others crepuscular. There is considerable variety of appearance in the family,
  although it is but a small one, and many of its members remind one of other and widely separated
  families of Lepidoptera. The style and colour of the Japanese <i>Eusemia villicoides</i> are
  remarkably like our <i>Arctia villica</i>. In some forms the antennae are somewhat thickened
  towards the tip and hooked, like those of the Skipper butterflies. The family consists at present
  of about 250 species, but we doubt its being a sufficiently natural one. It is very widely
  distributed, with the exception that it is quite absent from Europe and the neighbourhood of the
  Mediterranean Sea. In North America it is well represented. The larvae, so far as known, are not
  very remarkable; they have some lateral tufts of hair, as well as longer hairs scattered over the
  body.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page411"><span class="smaller">{411}</span></span></div>

  <p>The male of the Indian <i>Aegocera tripartita</i> has been noticed to produce a clicking sound
  when flying, and Sir G. Hampson has shown<a id="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> that
  there is a peculiar structure on the anterior wing; he considers that this is rubbed against some
  spines on the front feet, and that the sound is produced by the friction. Though this structure is
  wanting in the acknowledged congeners of <i>A. tripartita</i>, yet it occurs in a very similar
  form in the genus <i>Hecatesia</i>, already noticed under Castniidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 36. Geometridae</b> (<i>Carpets</i>, <i>Pugs</i>, <i>etc.</i>)&mdash;This very
  extensive family consists of fragile moths, only a small number being moderately stout forms; they
  have a large wing-area; the antennae are frequently highly developed in the males, but on this
  point there is much diversity. Either the frenulum or the proboscis is absent in a few cases. The
  caterpillars are elongate and slender, with only one pair of abdominal feet&mdash;placed on the
  ninth segment&mdash;in addition to the anal pair, or claspers. They progress by moving these two
  pairs of feet up to the thoracic legs, so that the body is thrown into a large loop, and they are
  hence called Loopers or Geometers. The family is universally distributed, and occurs even in
  remote islands and high latitudes; in Britain we have about 270 species. The family was formerly
  considered to be closely connected with Noctuidae, but at present the opinion that it has more
  intimate relations with the families we have previously considered is prevalent. Packard considers
  it near to Lithosiidae, while Meyrick merely places the six families, of which he treats it as
  composed, in his series Notodontina. Hampson adopts Meyrick's six families as subfamilies, but
  gives them different names, being in this respect more conservative than Meyrick, whose recent
  revision of the European forms resulted in drastic changes in nomenclature.<a id="NtA_305"
  href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> This classification is based almost exclusively on
  wing-nervuration. The number of larval legs and the consequent mode of walking is one of the most
  constant characters of the group; the few exceptions that have been detected are therefore of
  interest. <i>Anisopteryx aescularia</i> has a pair of undeveloped feet on the eighth segment, and,
  according to Meyrick, its allies "sometimes show rudiments of the other two pairs." The larva of
  <i>Himera <span class="pagenum" id="page412"><span class="smaller">{412}</span></span>pennaria</i>
  is said to have in early life a pair of imperfect feet on the eighth segment, which disappear as
  the larva approaches maturity.</p>

      1. Cambridge.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The position of the abdominal feet and claspers throws the holding power of the larva to the
  posterior part of the body, instead of to the middle, as in other caterpillars. This, combined
  with the elongate form, causes these larvae when reposing to assume attitudes more or less
  different from those of other larvae; holding on by the claspers, some of these Insects allow all
  the anterior parts of the body to project in a twig-like manner. The front parts are not, however,
  really free in such cases, but are supported by a thread of silk extending from the mouth to some
  point near-by. Another plan adopted is to prop the front part of the body against a twig placed at
  right angles to the supporting leaf, so that the caterpillar is in a diagonal line between the two
  (Fig. 202). Other Geometers assume peculiar coiled or spiral attitudes during a whole or a portion
  of their lives; some doing this on a supporting object&mdash;leaf or twig&mdash;while others hang
  down (<i>Ephyra pendularia</i>). Certain of the larvae of Geometridae vary in colour, from shades
  of brown to green; there is much diversity in this variation. In some species it is simple
  variation; in others it is dimorphism, <i>i.e.</i> the larvae are either brown or green. In other
  cases the larvae are at first variable, subsequently dimorphic. In <i>Amphidasis betularia</i> it
  would appear that when the larva is hatched the dimorphism is potential, and that the future
  colour, whether <span class="pagenum" id="page413"><span class="smaller">{413}</span></span>green
  or brown, is settled by some determining condition during the first period of larval life and
  cannot be subsequently modified.<a id="NtA_306" href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> According to
  Poulton, the dark tint is due in <i>A. betularia</i> to colouring matter in the skin or
  immediately below it, and the green tint to a layer of fat between the hypodermis and the
  superficial muscles; this layer being always green, but more brightly green in the larvae that are
  of this colour externally. Much discussion has occurred about these larval attitudes and colours,
  and it seems probable that Professor Poulton has overrated the value of protection from birds,
  mammals and entomologists; the chief destroying agents being other than these, and not liable to
  be thus deceived, even if the vertebrates are. In some cases such resemblance as undoubtedly
  exists is not made the best use of. The larva shown in figure 202 bore a wonderful resemblance,
  when examined, to the rose-twigs it lived on, but the effect of this as a concealing agent was
  entirely destroyed by the attitude; for this, being on different lines to those of the plant,
  attracted the eye at once. This larva, and we may add numerous other larvae, could have been
  perfectly concealed by adopting a different attitude, but never did so; the position represented
  being constantly maintained except while feeding.</p>

  <p>In some species of this family the adult females are without wings, or have them so small that
  they can be of no use for flight. This curious condition occurs in various and widely-separated
  groups of the Geometridae; and it would be naturally supposed to have a great effect on the
  economy of the species exhibiting it, but this is not the case. Some of the flightless females
  affect the highest trees and, it is believed, ascend to their very summits to oviposit. It has
  been suggested that they are carried up by the winged males, but this is probably only an
  exceptional occurrence; while, as they are known to be capable of ascending with rapidity by means
  of crawling and running, it may be taken for granted that this is the usual method with them. Some
  of these wingless females have been found in numbers on gas-lamps, and are believed to have been
  attracted by the light, as is the case with very many of the winged forms.<a id="NtA_307"
  href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page414"><span
  class="smaller">{414}</span></span>Neither is the geographical distribution limited by this
  inferior condition of the most important of the organs of locomotion, for <i>Cheimatobia
  brumata</i> (the Winter-moth) one of the species with flightless female, is a common and widely
  distributed Insect in Europe and North America.</p>

  <p>Although the classification of this family is based almost entirely on wing-nervuration, yet
  there are some divisions of the Geometridae in which this character is remarkably variable,
  certain individuals frequently exhibiting considerable abnormality.<a id="NtA_308"
  href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> <i>Amphidasis betularia</i> is believed to have changed its
  variation considerably in the course of the last fifty years. Previous to that time a black
  variety of the species was unknown, but it has now become common; and it is believed that other
  species of Geometridae are in process of exhibiting a similar phenomenon.<a id="NtA_309"
  href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 37. Noctuidae</b> (<i>Owlet-Moths</i>, <i>Eulen</i> of the Germans).&mdash;This very
  extensive assemblage consists of moths rarely seen in the day-time, of generally sombre colours,
  with antennae destitute of remarkable developments in the male (except in a small number of
  forms); proboscis and frenulum both present; a complex sense-organ on each side of the body at the
  junction of the metathorax and abdomen. The number of species already known can scarcely be less
  than 8000; owing to their large numbers and the great general resemblance of the forms, their
  classification is a matter of considerable difficulty. Although the peculiar structure at the base
  of the thorax was long since pointed out, it has never received any thorough investigation. Few
  other remarkable structures have yet been discovered: the most interesting is perhaps the
  peculiarity in the hind wings of the males of certain Ommatophorinae recently pointed out by Sir
  G. F. Hampson<a id="NtA_310" href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a>: in the genera <i>Patula</i> and
  <i>Argiva</i> the form of the hind wings is normal in the females, but in the male the anterior
  one-half of each of these wings is aborted, and the position of the nervures changed; this
  condition is connected with the development of a glandular patch or fold on the wing, and is
  remarkable as profoundly affecting a structure which is <span class="pagenum" id="page415"><span
  class="smaller">{415}</span></span>otherwise so constant that the classification of the family is
  largely based on it.</p>

      <p class="sp0">Fig. 203&mdash;<i>Brephos notha.</i> Larva, newly hatched. Britain.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The larvae are as a rule destitute of the remarkable adornments of hairs and armatures of
  spines that are so common in many of the families we have previously considered; they are fond of
  concealing themselves during the day and coming out at night to feed; many of them pass most of
  their time at, or beneath, the surface of the ground, finding nourishment in roots or the lower
  parts of the stems of plants; this is notably the case in the genus <i>Agrotis</i>, which is
  perhaps the most widely distributed of all the genera of moths. Such caterpillars are known as
  Cut-worms in North America.<a id="NtA_311" href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> The great
  resemblance, <i>inter se</i>, of certain of these Cut-worms, much astonished the American
  naturalist Harris, who found that larvae almost perfectly similar produced very different moths.
  The majority of Noctuid larvae have the usual number of legs, viz., three pairs of thoracic legs,
  four pairs of abdominal feet and the terminal claspers. In some divisions of the family there is a
  departure from this arrangement, and the abdominal feet are reduced to three, or even to two,
  pairs. One or two larvae are known&mdash;e.g. <i>Euclidia mi</i>&mdash;in which the claspers have
  not the usual function, but are free terminal appendages. When the abdominal legs are reduced in
  number (<i>Plusia</i>, e.g.) the larvae are said to be Half-loopers, or Semi-loopers, as they
  assume to some extent the peculiar mode of progression of the Geometrid larvae, which are known as
  Loopers. In the case of certain larvae, e.g. <i>Triphaena</i>, that have the normal number of
  feet, it has been observed that when first hatched, the one or two anterior pairs of the abdominal
  set are ill developed, and the larvae do not use them for walking. This is the case with the young
  larva of our British <i>Brephos notha</i> (Fig. 203). Subsequently, however, this larva undergoes
  a considerable change, and appears in the form shown in Fig. 204. This interesting larva joins
  together two or three <span class="pagenum" id="page416"><span
  class="smaller">{416}</span></span>leaves of aspen and lives between them, an unusual habit for
  Noctuid larvae. When about to pupate it bores into bark or soft wood to change to a pupa, Fig.
  205; the specimen represented closed the hole of entry by placing two separate doors of silk
  across the burrow, as shown at <i>d</i>. The anal armature of this pupa is terminated by a curious
  transverse process. The systematic position of this interesting Insect is very uncertain: Meyrick
  and others associate it with the Geometridae.</p>

  <p>The larva of <i>Leucania unipunctata</i> is the notorious Army-worm that commits great ravages
  on grass and corn in North America. This species sometimes increases in numbers to a considerable
  extent without being observed, owing to the retiring habits of the larvae; when, however, the
  increase of numbers has been so great that food becomes scarce, or for some other cause&mdash;for
  the scarcity of food is supposed not to be the only reason&mdash;the larvae become gregarious, and
  migrate in enormous swarms: whence its popular name. The Cotton-worm, <i>Aletia xylinae</i> is
  even more notorious on account of its ravages. Riley states<a id="NtA_312"
  href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> that in bad years the mischief it commits on the cotton crop
  causes a loss of &pound;6,000,000, and that for a period of fourteen successive years the annual loss
  averaged about &pound;3,000,000. This caterpillar strips the cotton plants of all but their branches. It
  is assisted in its work by another highly destructive Noctuid caterpillar, the Boll-worm, or larva
  of <i>Heliothis armigera</i>, which bores into the buds and pods. This <span class="pagenum"
  id="page417"><span class="smaller">{417}</span></span>latter Insect attacks a great variety of
  plants, and has a very wide distribution, being found even in England, where happily it is always
  a rare Insect.</p>

  <p>In Britain, as well as in parts of Northern Europe, a Noctuid moth, <i>Charaeas graminis</i>,
  occasionally increases to an enormous extent: its larva is called the Hill-grub and lives on the
  grass of pastures, frequently doing great damage in hill-lands. The increase of this moth seems to
  take place after the manner of an epidemic; a considerable number of years may pass during which
  it is scarcely seen, and it will then appear in unusual numbers in widely separated localities.
  This moth lays a large number of eggs, and is not completely nocturnal in habits; sometimes it may
  be seen on the wing in great numbers in the hottest sunshine, and it has been noticed that there
  is then a great disproportion of the sexes, the females being ten or twenty times as numerous as
  the males. In Australia, the Bugong moth, <i>Agrotis spina</i>, occurs in millions in certain
  localities in Victoria: this moth hibernates as an imago, and it formerly formed, in this instar,
  an important article of food with the aborigines. The powers of increase of another Noctuid
  moth&mdash;<i>Erastria scitula</i>&mdash;are of great value. Its habits have been described by
  Rouzaud.<a id="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> On the shores of the Mediterranean the
  larva of this little moth lives on a Scale-Insect&mdash;<i>Lecanium oleae</i>&mdash;that infests
  the peach; and as the moth may have as many as five generations in a year, it commits laudable
  havoc with the pest. The larva is of remarkable form, very short and convex, with small head, and
  only two pairs of abdominal feet. The scale of the <i>Lecanium</i> is of larger size than is usual
  in that group of Insects, and the young larva of the <i>Erastria</i> buries itself, as soon as
  hatched, in one of the scales; it destroys successively numerous scales, and after having
  undergone several moults, it finds itself provided, for the first time, with a spinneret, when,
  with the aid of its silk, it adds to and adapts a Coccid scale, and thus forms a portable
  habitation; this it holds on to by means of the pair of anal claspers, which are of unusual form.
  The case is afterwards subjected to further alteration, so that it may serve as a protection to
  the creature when it has changed to a pupa. This moth is said to be free from the attacks of
  parasites, and if this be the case it is probable that its increase is regulated by the fact that
  <span class="pagenum" id="page418"><span class="smaller">{418}</span></span>when the creature
  becomes numerous it thus reduces the food supply, so that its own numbers are afterwards in
  consequence diminished.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable genera of British Noctuidae is <i>Acronycta</i>,<a id="NtA_314"
  href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a> the larvae of which exhibit so much diversity that it has been
  suggested that the genus should be dismembered and its fragments treated as allied to several
  different divisions of moths. There are many points of interest in connection with the natural
  history of these <i>Acronycta</i>. <i>A. psi</i> and <i>A. ridens</i> are practically
  indistinguishable as moths, though the larvae are easily separated: the former species is said to
  be destroyed to an amazing extent by parasites, yet it remains a common Insect. The genus
  <i>Apatela</i> is very closely allied to <i>Acronycta</i>, and Harris says that "<i>Apatela</i>
  signifies deceptive, and this name was probably given to the genus because the caterpillars appear
  in the dress of Arctians and Liparians, but produce true owlet-moths or Noctuas."<a id="NtA_315"
  href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> The species of another British genus, <i>Bryophila</i>,
  possess the exceptional habit of feeding on lichens. Some of the American group Erebides are
  amongst the largest Insects, measuring seven or eight inches across the expanded wings.</p>

  <p>The Deltoid moths are frequently treated as a distinct family, Deltoidae, perhaps chiefly
  because of their resemblance to Pyralidae. At present, however, they are considered to be
  separated from Noctuidae by no valid characters.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 38. Epicopeiidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Epicopeia</i> consists of only a few moths,
  but they are amongst the most extraordinary known: at first sight they would be declared without
  hesitation to be large swallow-tail butterflies, and Hampson states that they "mimic" the Papilios
  of the <i>Polyxenus</i> group. Very little is known about these extremely rare Insects, but the
  larva is stated, on the authority of Mr. Dudgeon, to surpass the moths themselves in extravagance;
  to be covered with long processes of snow-white efflorescence, like wax, exuded from the skin, and
  to "mimic" a colony of the larva of a Homopterous Insect. Some ten species of this genus are known
  from Java, India, China, and Japan. In this family there is said to be a rudimentary frenulum, but
  it is doubtful whether the hairs that have given rise to this definition really justify it.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page419"><span class="smaller">{419}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 39. Uraniidae.</b>&mdash;A family of small extent, including light-bodied moths with
  ample wings and thread-like antennae; most of them resemble Geometridae, but a few genera,
  <i>Urania</i> and <i>Nyctalemon</i>, are like Swallow-tail butterflies and have similar habits.
  The Madagascar moth, <i>Chrysiridia madagascariensis</i> (better known as <i>Urania rhipheus</i>),
  is a most elegant and beautiful Insect, whose only close allies (except an East African congener)
  are the tropical American species of <i>Urania</i>, which were till recently treated as
  undoubtedly congeneric with the Madagascar moth. The family consists of but six genera and some
  sixty species. The question of its affinities has given rise to much discussion, but on the whole
  it would appear that these Insects are least ill-placed near Noctuidae.<a id="NtA_316"
  href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> The larva of the South American genus <i>Coronidia</i> is in
  general form like a Noctuid larva, and has the normal number of legs; it possesses a few peculiar
  fleshy processes on the back. A description of the larva of <i>Chrysiridia madagascariensis</i>
  has been widely spread; but according to Cambou&eacute;,<a id="NtA_317"
  href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> the account of the metamorphoses, first given by Boisduval, is
  erroneous. The larva, it appears, resembles in general form that of <i>Coronidia</i>, and has
  sixteen feet; it is, however, armed with long, spatulate black hairs; it changes to a pupa in a
  cocoon of open network.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In all the species of this family we have examined, we have noticed the existence of a highly
  peculiar structure that seems hitherto to have escaped observation. On each side of the second
  abdominal segment there is an ear-like opening (usually <span class="pagenum" id="page420"><span
  class="smaller">{420}</span></span>much concealed by overlapping scales), giving entrance to a
  chamber in the body; this chamber extends to the middle line, being separated from its fellow by
  only a thin partition. At its anterior and lateral part there is a second vesicle-like chamber,
  formed by a delicate membrane that extends as far forwards as the base of the abdomen. There can
  be little doubt that this is part of some kind of organ of sense, though it is much larger than is
  usual with Insect sense-organs.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 40. Epiplemidae.</b>&mdash;Under this name Hampson has assembled certain Geometroid
  moths, some of them placed previously in Chalcosiidae, some in Geometridae. They form a varied
  group, apparently closely allied to Uraniidae, and having a similar peculiar sense-organ; but are
  distinguished by the presence of a frenulum. The larva seems to be like that of Uraniidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 41. Pyralidae.</b>&mdash;This division is to be considered rather as a group of
  families than as a family; it includes a very large number of small or moderate-sized moths of
  fragile structure, frequently having long legs; antennae simple, only in a few cases pectinate;
  distinguished from Noctuidae and all the other extensive divisions of moths by the peculiar course
  of the costal nervure of the hind wing, which either keeps, in the middle of its course, near to
  the sub-costal or actually unites with it, subsequently again separating. Members of the Pyralidae
  are found in all lands; in Britain we have about 150 species. The larvae are usually nearly bare,
  with only short, scattered setae, and little coloration; they have most varied habits, are fond of
  concealment, and are very lively and abrupt in movement, wriggling backwards as well as forwards,
  when disturbed; a cocoon is formed for the metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>The family as a whole consists of Insects of unattractive appearance, although it contains some
  very elegant and interesting moths and numerous forms of structural interest. In the genus
  <i>Thiridopteryx</i> little transparent spaces on the wings occur as a character peculiar to the
  males; the spaces are correlative with a greater or less derangement of the wing-nervures. In some
  other forms there is a remarkable retinaculum, consisting of large scales, and this, too, is
  connected with a distortion of the wing-nervures. The Pyralidae&mdash;Pyralites of Ragonot,<a
  id="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> Pyralidina of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page421"><span class="smaller">{421}</span></span>Meyrick&mdash;have recently been revised by
  two naturalists of distinction almost simultaneously; unfortunately their results are discrepant,
  Meyrick including Pterophoridae and Orneodidae, and yet admitting in all only eight families;
  while Ragonot does not include the two groups named, but defines seventeen tribes of the two
  families&mdash;Pyralidae and Crambidae&mdash;that he admits.</p>

  <p>The Pyraustidae of Meyrick is an enormous division including the Hydrocampidae and Scopariidae
  of many authors, as well as the Pyraustinae proper and a small group of Ragonot's, the
  Homophysinae. The division Scopariinae is believed to be amongst the "most ancient" of
  Lepidoptera; the food of the larvae consists of moss and lichens. This group is widely
  distributed, being richly represented in Australia, New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands, as well
  as in Europe; and probably really occurs wherever their food-plants exist accompanied by a
  tolerable climate. The statistics of the distribution of this group, so far as at present known,
  have been furnished by Mr. Meyrick, as follows:&mdash;European region, about 25 species; Madeira,
  3; St. Helena, 6; South Africa, 2 or 3; India, 9; Malayan region, 3 or 4; Australia, 24; New
  Zealand, 64; Hawaiian Islands, 50; North America, 17 (one of them European); South America, 10.
  The Hydrocampinae&mdash;the China-marks&mdash;are of great interest, as being amongst the few
  forms of Lepidoptera adapted for aquatic life. It is believed that all their larvae are aquatic,
  though of only a few is there much known. The diversity amongst these forms is of considerable
  interest. The habits of <i>Hydrocampa nymphaeata</i> were long since described by R&eacute;aumur, and
  have more recently been dealt with by Buckler,<a id="NtA_319" href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a>
  W. M&uuml;ller<a id="NtA_320" href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> and Prof. Miall.<a id="NtA_321"
  href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> Although there are some discrepancies in their accounts, due
  we believe to the observations being made at different periods of the life and under somewhat
  different circumstances, yet the account given by M&uuml;ller is we feel no doubt substantially
  correct. The larvae when hatched mine in the leaves of a water-plant for a short time&mdash;thirty
  hours to three days according to Buckler&mdash;and are completely surrounded by water, which
  penetrates freely into their burrows; at this period the caterpillar breathes by its skin, the
  spiracles being very small, and the tubes leading from <span class="pagenum" id="page422"><span
  class="smaller">{422}</span></span>them closed and functionless. After this brief period of mining
  life, the larva moults and then constructs a habitation by cutting a piece out of a leaf, and
  fastening it to the under side of another leaf; it is thus provided with a habitation, but it is
  one into which the water freely enters, and the respiratory apparatus remains in the state we have
  described. The Insect passes through several moults, and then hibernates in the water. On its
  revival in the spring a change occurs, and the larva constructs a portable, or we should rather
  say free, habitation out of two large pieces of leaf of lens-shape, fastened together at the
  edges; but the larva has some method of managing matters so that the water can be kept out of this
  house; thus the creature lives in air though immersed in the water. A correlative change occurs in
  the structure of the skin and tracheal system. The former becomes studded with prominent points
  that help to maintain a coat of air round the Insect, like dry velvet immersed in water; the
  spiracles are larger than they were, and they and the tracheal tubes are open. One or two moults
  take place and the creature then pupates. There is a good deal of discrepancy in the accounts of
  this period, and it seems probable that the pupa is sometimes aerial, sometimes aquatic. Buckler's
  account of the formation of the case shows that the larva first cuts off, by an ingenious process,
  one piece of leaf, leaving itself on this, as on a raft; this it guides to a leaf suitable for a
  second piece, gets the raft underneath, and fastens it with silk to the upper portion, and then
  severs this, leaving the construction free; afterwards the larva goes through a curious process of
  changing its position and working at the two extremities of the case, apparently with the object
  of making it all right as regards its capacity for including air and keeping out water. He
  believes that R&eacute;aumur was correct in his idea that the larva regulates the admission of air or of
  water to the case in conformity with its needs for respiration. M&uuml;ller calls special attention to
  the great changes in habit and in the structure of the integument during the life of this larva;
  but the reader will gather from what we relate as to various terrestrial Lepidopterous larvae,
  that these phenomena are not very dissimilar from what frequently take place in the latter; a
  change of habits at some particular moult, accompanied by great changes in the integument, and
  even in the size of the stigmata, being of frequent occurrence.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page423"><span class="smaller">{423}</span></span></div>

  <p>The larva of <i>Nymphula stagnata</i>, a close ally of <i>H. nymphaeata</i>, has aquatic habits
  of a somewhat similar but simpler nature; while <i>N.</i> (<i>Paraponyx</i>) <i>stratiotata</i> is
  very different. This larva is provided with eight rows of tufts of flexible branchiae, occupying
  the position of the spots or setigerous warts usual in caterpillars, and reminding one of the
  spines of certain butterfly-larvae, though they are undoubtedly respiratory filaments. These
  caterpillars protect themselves by forming silken webs or cases, or by adopting the case of some
  other larva, and are in the habit of holding on by the anal claspers, and rapidly and
  energetically moving the anterior parts of the body in an undulating fashion. The spiracles exist,
  but are functionless. The pupa lives under water, and has no branchiae; but three of the pairs of
  abdominal spiracles are open, and project from the body. M&uuml;ller informs us that in a Brazilian
  <i>Paraponyx</i> these three pairs of spiracles were already large in the larva, though the other
  pairs were very small, or absent. He considers that the moth of this species descends beneath the
  water of a rapid stream, and fastens its eggs on the stems of plants therein. <i>Cataclysta
  lemnata</i> lives in a case of silk with leaves of duckweed attached to it, or in a piece of a
  hollow stem of some aquatic plant; it is believed to breathe, like <i>H. nymphaeata</i>, at first
  by the integument and subsequently by open stigmata; but particulars as to how it obtains the
  requisite air-supply are not forthcoming: the aquatic pupa breathes by three large abdominal
  spiracles like <i>Paraponyx</i>.</p>

  <p>Musotimidae<a id="NtA_322" href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> is a small group of two or three
  genera found in Australia and Polynesia; and the Tineodidae also consist of only two Australian
  genera. Siculodidae is likewise a small Antarctic group, placed by Meyrick in Pyralidina; but his
  view is not accepted by Snellen and Ragonot. Epipaschiinae (formerly treated as a separate family)
  and Endotrichiinae are, according to Meyrick, subdivisions of the family Pyralidae proper, an
  enormous group of more than 100 genera. The Chrysauginae consist chiefly of American forms, and
  have not been treated by Meyrick; some of this group have been classed with Tortricidae or
  Deltoidae on account of the undulating costa of the front wings and the long, peculiar palpi. The
  Galleriidae are a small group including Insects that live in bees'-nests, and feed on the wax
  <span class="pagenum" id="page424"><span class="smaller">{424}</span></span>etc.; others eat
  seeds, or dried vegetable substances. Three out of our five British species of this family occur
  (usually gregariously) in bee-hives, and have the peculiar habit of spinning their cocoons
  together. The mass of common cocoons formed in this manner by <i>Aphomia sociella</i> is
  remarkably tough and enduring; portions of it are not infrequently picked up, and as the cocoons
  are of a peculiar tubular form their nature gives rise to some perplexity.</p>

  <p>Phycitidae<a id="NtA_323" href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> is another very large assemblage
  of Insects with very diverse habits. The frenulum and retinaculum are similarly formed in the two
  sexes: the males frequently have the basal-joint of the antennae swollen; hence the term
  "Knot-horns" applied by collectors to these moths. The larvae of the species of <i>Ephestia</i>
  infest groceries, and most children have become to a slight extent acquainted with them amongst
  dried figs; that of <i>E. kuehniella</i> has become very injurious in flour-mills, its enormous
  increase being due in all probability to the fact that the favourable and equable temperature
  maintained in the mills promotes a rapid succession of generations, so that the Insect may
  increase to such an extent as to entirely block the machinery. Many of the Phycitidae feed on the
  bark of trees in galleries or tunnels constructed partially of silk. A very peculiar modification
  of this habit in <i>Cecidipta excoecaria</i> has been described by Berg.<a id="NtA_324"
  href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a> In Argentina this Insect takes possession of the galls formed
  by a <i>Chermes</i> on <i>Excoecaria biglandulosa</i>, a Euphorbiaceous tree. The female moth lays
  an egg on a gall, and the resulting larva bores into the gall and nourishes itself on the interior
  till all is eaten except a thin external coat; the caterpillar then pupates in this chamber. The
  galls vary in size and shape, and the larva displays much constructive ability in adapting its
  home to its needs by the addition of tubes of silk or by other modes. Sometimes the amount of food
  furnished by the interior of the gall is not sufficient; the larva, in such cases, resorts to the
  leaves of the plant for a supplement, but does not eat them in the usual manner of a caterpillar;
  it cuts off and carries a leaf to the entrance of its abode, fastens the leaf there with silk, and
  then itself entering, feeds, from the interior, on the food it has thus acquired. Another
  Phycitid, <i>Dakruma coccidivora</i> is very <span class="pagenum" id="page425"><span
  class="smaller">{425}</span></span>beneficial in North America by eating large Scale-Insects of
  the <i>Lecanium</i> group, somewhat after the fashion of <i>Erastria scitula</i>; it does not
  construct a case, but shelters itself when walking from one scale to another by means of silken
  tubes; it suffers from the attacks of parasites.<a id="NtA_325"
  href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> Oxychirotinae, an Australian group, is interesting because,
  according to Meyrick, it possesses forms connecting the Pterophoridae with the more normal
  Pyralids.</p>

  <p>Crambidae, or Grass-moths, are amongst the most abundant Lepidoptera in this country, as they
  include the little pale moths that fly for short distances amongst the grass of lawns and
  pastures; they fold their wings tightly to their body, and have a head pointed in front, in
  consequence of the form and direction of the palpi. They sit in an upright position on the stems
  of grass, and it has been said that this is done because then they are not conspicuous. Perhaps:
  but it would be a somewhat difficult acrobatic performance to sit with six legs across a stem of
  grass. The larvae are feeders on grass, and construct silken tunnels about the roots at or near
  the surface. The Ancylolominae are included in Crambidae by Meyrick and Hampson. Schoenobiinae<a
  id="NtA_326" href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> are included by Meyrick in Pyraustidae, but this
  view appears not to meet with acceptance, and the group is more usually associated with the
  Crambidae. Most writers place the anomalous genus <i>Acentropus</i> as a separate tribe, but it is
  associated by both Meyrick and Hampson with <i>Schoenobius</i>. This Insect is apparently the most
  completely aquatic of all the Lepidoptera, and was for long associated with the Trichoptera in
  consequence of its habits and of the scaling of the wings being of a very inferior kind. The males
  may sometimes be found in large numbers fluttering over the surface of shallow, but large, bodies
  of water; the females are rarely seen, and in some cases have no wings, or have these organs so
  small as to be useless. The female, it would appear, comes quite to the surface for coupling, and
  then takes the male beneath the water. The larvae have the usual number of Lepidopterous feet, and
  apparently feed on the leaves of plants below water just as Lepidopterous larvae ordinarily do in
  the air.<a id="NtA_327" href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> They have no trace of gills, and their
  <span class="pagenum" id="page426"><span class="smaller">{426}</span></span>mode of respiration is
  unknown. A great deal has been written about these Insects, but really very little is known. They
  are abundant, though local in many parts of North and Central Europe; some of the females have, as
  we have said, abbreviated wings, but how many species there are, and whether the modifications
  existing in the development of the wings are constant in one species or locality, are unknown as
  yet.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 42. Pterophoridae</b><a id="NtA_328" href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a>
  (<i>Plume-moths</i>).&mdash;Elegant Insects of small size, usually with the wings divided (after
  the fashion of a hand into fingers) so as to form feathers: the extent of this division is
  diverse, but the hind wings are more completely divided than the front, which indeed are sometimes
  almost entire. The group is placed by Meyrick in his Pyralidina, but there are many entomologists
  who look on it as distinct. It consists of two sub-families, Agdistinae and Pterophorinae, that
  have been treated as families by many entomologists. The Agdistinae (of which we have a British
  representative of the only genus <i>Agdistes</i>) have the wings undivided. Pterophorinae have the
  hind wings trifid or (rarely) quadrifid, the front wings bifid or (rarely) trifid. The larvae of
  the Pterophorinae are different from those of Pyralidae, being slow in movement and of heavy form,
  covered with hair and living exposed on leaves; the pupae are highly remarkable, being soft,
  coloured somewhat like the larvae, and also hairy like the larvae, and are attached somewhat after
  the manner of butterfly-pupae by the cremaster: but in some cases there is a slight cocoon. There
  is, however, much variety in the larval and pupal habits of the Pterophoridae, many having habits
  of concealment of divers kinds. We have thirty species of these lovely Plume-moths in Britain. The
  family is widely distributed, and will probably prove numerous in species when the small and
  delicate Insects existing in the tropics are more appreciated by collectors.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 43. Alucitidae</b> (<b>Orneodidae</b> of Meyrick and others).&mdash;The genus
  <i>Alucita</i> includes the only moths that have the front and hind wings divided each into six
  feathers. Species of it, though not numerous, occur in various regions. The larva and pupa are
  less anomalous than those of the Pterophoridae, though the imago is more anomalous. The
  caterpillar of our British <i>A. polydactyla</i> feeds on the flower-buds of honey-suckle, and
  forms a <span class="pagenum" id="page427"><span class="smaller">{427}</span></span>cocoon. The
  moth with wings expanded is about an inch across, and is a lovely object. It is not rare, though
  seldom numerous.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 44. Tortricidae.</b>&mdash;Moths of small size, with a rather ample wing area, with the
  wing-fringes never as long as the wings are wide (long across), the hind wings without a pattern:
  the anterior nervure on the hind wings is simply divergent from that next to it, and the internal
  nervure, 1b, is very evidently forked at the base. The larvae inhabit their food, which may be
  rolled up or twisted leaves, or the interior of fruits and herbs, or galls, or even roots; they
  exhibit less diversity than is usual in other large series of moths; all have the normal
  complement of sixteen legs. This group is a very extensive one, but is much neglected owing to the
  great difficulties attending its study; it is not recognised in Hampson's Table of families given
  on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page370">370</a></span>, being there merged in Tineidae. It
  appears, however, to be a really natural group, and it is not desirable to merge it in the
  sufficiently enormous assemblage of the Tineidae till this has been shown to be necessary by the
  light of a greater knowledge of the external anatomy than we possess at present. The term
  Microlepidoptera is frequently met with in entomological literature, and should, we think, be
  confined to the two series Tortricidae and Tineidae. The Pterophoridae, and even the Pyralidae,
  have been, and still sometimes are, included under this term, but at present it seems best to
  limit its application as is here suggested.</p>

  <p>Three great divisions are at present recognised; these were formerly called by Meyrick,<a
  id="NtA_329" href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> Tortricidae, Grapholithidae, Conchylidae;
  subsequently,<a id="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> he has adopted the names
  Tortricidae, Epiblemidae, Phaloniadae. Lord Walsingham, who has devoted a great deal of time and
  study to the elucidation of this most difficult group, has suggested<a id="NtA_331"
  href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> that another change is desirable, and if so the nomenclature
  will be:&mdash;1. Tortricidae [or Tortricinae, according to the view that may be taken as to the
  group being family or sub-family]; 2. Phaloniidae [= the formerly used name, Conchylidae]; 3.
  Olethreutidae [= the formerly used name Grapholithinae = Epiblemidae, Meyr.]. We have upwards of
  300 species in Britain, nearly 200 of which belong to the last division. The name Tortricidae
  refers to the habit the <span class="pagenum" id="page428"><span
  class="smaller">{428}</span></span>larvae of these moths possess of rolling up leaves, or twisting
  and distorting shoots and buds.</p>

  <p>The mode in which leaves and shoots are twisted and rolled by the very small larvae has been
  much discussed and is probably the result of two or three distinct causes:&mdash;1, the immediate
  operations of the larva; 2, the contraction of silk when drying; 3, changes in the mode of growth
  of the parts of the vegetable, resulting from the interference of the caterpillar. The larvae of
  this family that live in fruits are only too widely (we will not say well) known. Stainton gives
  as the habitat of <i>Epinotia funebrana</i>, "larva frequent in plum-pies"; the caterpillar of
  <i>Carpocapsa pomonella</i> (the Codling-moth) mines in apples and pears, and its ravages are
  known only too well in widely distant parts of the world where fruit-trees of this kind are
  cultivated. <i>C. splendana</i> lives in acorns and walnuts; <i>C. juliana</i> in Spanish
  chestnuts. Two, if not more, larvae live in the seeds of Euphorbiaceous plants, and have become
  notorious under the name of jumping-beans, on account of the movements they cause. As these latter
  show no trace externally of being inhabited, the movements are supposed to be a mysterious
  property of the seed; they are really due to its containing a large cavity, extending, in one
  direction of the seed, nearly or quite from skin to skin; in this the larva makes a movement
  sufficient to alter the point of equilibrium of the quiescent seed, or as a free body to strike
  some part of it. The exact nature of the movements of the larva have not, we believe, been
  ascertained. There are, at least, two species of these Insects, and two plants harbouring them,
  known in the United States and Mexico, viz. <i>Carpocapsa saltitans</i> living in the seeds of
  <i>Croton colliguaja</i> and <i>Grapholitha sebastianiae</i> living in the seeds of <i>Sebastiania
  bicapsularis</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 45. Tineidae</b>.&mdash;Small moths with the labial palpi more flexible and mobile than
  in other moths; usually separated and pointed. Hind wings frequently with very long fringes, the
  wing itself being proportionally reduced in size, and in consequence pointed at the tip. Larvae
  very diverse, almost always with habits of concealment. The series of forms included under this
  head is very numerous, the British species alone mounting up to 700, while the total described
  cannot be less than 4000. This number, however, must be but a fragment of what exists, if Mr.
  Meyrick be correct in supposing that a single one of the divisions of the
  family&mdash;Oecophoridae&mdash;comprises 2000 species in Australia and New Zealand alone.</p>

  <p>As the study of these Insects is attended with great difficulty on account of their fragility
  and the minute size of the great majority, it is not a matter for surprise that their
  classification is in a comparatively rudimentary state. We shall not, therefore, deal with it
  here. Neither can we attempt to give any idea of the extreme diversity in the colours, forms, and
  attitudes of these small Insects. The one shown in Fig. 207, is remarkable on account of the great
  accumulation of scales on the wings and legs. As regards the pointed wings and the long fringes,
  we may remark that it is probable that in many of these small forms the wings are passive agents
  in locomotion; a similar condition of the wings is found in other very minute Insects, <i>e.g.</i>
  Thysanoptera and Trichopterygidae; in all these cases the framework of the wings is nearly absent:
  in some forms of the Tineidae, <i>Opostega</i>, e.g. the nervules are reduced to three or four in
  each wing. The variety in habits is as great as that of the external form, and the larvae exceed
  in diversity those of any other group of Lepidoptera. No doubt a corresponding amount of diversity
  will be discovered in the details of structure of the perfect Insects, the anatomy of but few
  having been at present investigated. <i>Tinea pellionella</i> has two very important peculiarities
  in its internal anatomy: the testes consist of four round follicles on each side, and, contrary to
  the condition generally prevalent in Lepidoptera, are not brought together in a common capsule:
  the two groups are, however, not quite free (as they are in <i>Hepialus</i>), but are connected by
  a loose tracheal network. Even more remarkable is the fact also pointed out by Cholodkovsky<a
  id="NtA_332" href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> that the adult Insect possesses only two
  Malpighian tubes instead of six, the normal number in Lepidoptera; in the larva there are,
  however, six elongate tubes. The group of forms to which <span class="pagenum" id="page430"><span
  class="smaller">{430}</span></span><i>Tinea</i> belongs is remarkable for the diversity and
  exceptional character of the food-habits of the larvae; species subsist on dried camel's dung,
  various kinds of clothes, furs, and hair, and even about horns of deer and horses' hoofs: one
  species has been found in abundance in the hair of a live sloth, <i>Bradypus cuculliger</i>, under
  circumstances that render it possible that the larva feeds on the creature's hair, though it may
  feed on minute vegetable matter found in the hair. The larva of <i>Tinea vastella</i> is
  occasionally found feeding on the horns of living antelopes. Several species of Tineidae are known
  to devour Scale-Insects.</p>

  <p><i>Lita solanella</i> is notorious for the ravages it commits on stored potatoes. Quite a
  number of species live on cryptogamic matter, or in old wood; <i>Oinophila v-flavum</i> feeds on
  the mould on the walls of cellars, and is reputed to be injurious by occasionally also attacking
  the corks of bottles containing wine. <i>Oecocecis guyonella</i> is said to be the cause of galls
  on <i>Limoniastrum guyonianum</i>, a plant that, growing in the deserts to the south of Algeria,
  is a favourite food of camels, and is frequently entirely covered with sand. The deposition of an
  egg by this moth is believed by Gu&eacute;n&eacute;e<a id="NtA_333" href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> to give
  rise to a gall in which the larva is entirely enclosed (like the larvae of the gall-flies). Of
  Clothes-moths there are at least three species widely distributed. <i>Trichophaga tapetzella</i>
  is perhaps entitled to be considered the Clothes-moth; its caterpillar not only feeds on clothes,
  but spins webs and galleries amongst them. <i>Tinea pellionella</i> is also very common; its larva
  lives in a portable case, while that of the third species, <i>Tineola biselliella</i>, forms
  neither a case nor definite galleries. We have found this the most destructive of the three at
  Cambridge. Clothes or valuable furs may be completely protected by wrapping them in good sound
  paper in such a way that no crevices are left at the places where the edges of the paper meet.
  Garments that have become infested may be entirely cleared by free exposure to air and
  sunshine.</p>

  <p>Two species of <i>Tinea</i> have been recorded as viviparous, viz. <i>Tinea vivipara</i> in
  Australia, and an undetermined species in South America. The species of the genus
  <i>Solenobia</i>&mdash;in which the female is apterous&mdash;are frequently parthenogenetic. The
  group Taleporiidae, to which this genus belongs, is by some <span class="pagenum"
  id="page431"><span class="smaller">{431}</span></span>classified with Psychidae, in which family,
  as we have pointed out, one or two parthenogenetic forms are also known.</p>

  <p>The larvae of Tineidae, though they do not exhibit the remarkable armature found in so many of
  the larger caterpillars, are exceedingly diverse.<a id="NtA_334"
  href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> Some are entirely destitute of feet (<i>Phyllocnistis</i>).
  Others are destitute of the thoracic legs; <i>Nepticula</i> is in this case, but it is provided
  with an increased number of abdominal feet, in the form of more or less imperfect ventral
  processes. Some mine in leaves, others live in portable cases of various forms. Some are
  leaf-miners during their early life, and subsequently change their habits by constructing a
  portable case. The genus <i>Coleophora</i> affords numerous instances of this mode of life; the
  habits of these case-bearers exhibit considerable variety, and there are many points of interest
  in their life-histories. Change of habit during the larval life has already been alluded to as
  occurring in many Lepidoptera and is nowhere more strikingly exemplified than in certain Tineidae.
  Meyrick mentions the following case as occurring in an Australian Insect, <i>Nematobola
  orthotricha</i>;<a id="NtA_335" href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> the larva, until two-thirds
  grown, is without feet, and is almost colourless, and mines in the leaves of <i>Persoonia
  lanceolata</i>; but when two-thirds grown it acquires sixteen feet, changes colour, becoming very
  variegate, and feeds externally, unprotected, on the leaves. The cases of the case-bearing Tineids
  are usually of small size, and do not attract attention like those of Psychidae. A very remarkable
  one was discovered by Mr. E. E. Green in Ceylon, and was at first believed to be formed by a
  Caddis-worm. It has now been ascertained that the Insect forming it is the caterpillar of
  <i>Pseudodoxia limulus</i>, a Tineid moth of the group Depressariidae;<a id="NtA_336"
  href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a> the case is composed of minute fragments of moss, sand, and
  lichens; the anterior end is dilated into a shield-like hood that covers and protects the anterior
  parts of the larva when feeding; the food is mosses and lichens on rocks and trees. Before
  pupating, the larva folds down the edges of the hood over the mouth of the tube, like an envelope,
  fastening them with silk. The case is fixed to the rock or other support and hangs there until the
  moth appears.</p>

  <p>The family Prodoxidae consists of some Tineids, the larvae of which feed in the pods and stems
  of the Yuccas of south-western North America; they have the mouth of very unusual form (Fig. 208,
  E), and some of them, by aid of this peculiar mouth, exhibit a remarkable modification of
  instinct. The facts are chiefly known from the observations of Riley<a id="NtA_337"
  href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> on <i>Pronuba yuccasella</i>, a moth living on <i>Yucca
  filamentosa</i>; this plant has been introduced into our gardens in this country, where it never,
  we believe, produces seed. The Yuccas are not fitted for self-fertilisation or for fertilisation
  by Insect agency of an ordinary kind. The progeny of the moth develops in the pods of the plant,
  and as these cannot grow until the flowers have been fertilised, the moth has the habit of
  fertilising the flowers at the time she lays her egg in the part that is to develop into the pod,
  and to be the food for her own progeny. The female moth first visits the stamens, and collects, by
  the aid of the <span class="pagenum" id="page433"><span
  class="smaller">{433}</span></span>maxillae (which in this sex are very remarkably formed),<a
  id="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> a considerable mass of pollen, which she holds by
  means of the peculiar maxillary tentacles; she then lays an egg in the pistil, usually of some
  flower other than that from which she has gathered the pollen; and after she has accomplished this
  act she carefully applies the pollen she had previously collected to the pistil, so as to secure
  the fertilisation of the flower and the development of the pod.</p>

  <p>The species of <i>Prodoxus</i> stand in a very peculiar relation to <i>Pronuba</i>. They also
  live in Yuccas, and have habits similar to those of <i>Pronuba</i>, with the important exception
  that, being destitute of the requisite apparatus, they do not fertilise the Yucca-flowers, and are
  thus dependent on <i>Pronuba</i> for the steps being taken that are necessary for the rearing of
  the progeny of the two kinds of moth. Hence the name of Yucca-moth has been bestowed on
  <i>Pronuba</i>, and that of "bogus Yucca-moth" on the <i>Prodoxus</i>. The <i>Pronuba</i> we
  figure is the largest and most remarkable species of the genus and fertilises <i>Yucca
  brevifolia</i>; the larva is destitute of abdominal feet, and in the pupa the spines on the back
  that exist in nearly all pupae that live in stems are developed to an extraordinary extent. The
  Yuccas do not flower every year, and the Prodoxidae have a corresponding uncertainty as to their
  periods of appearance, passing sometimes a year or two longer than usual in the pupal stage.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 46. Eriocephalidae.</b>&mdash;This family has recently been proposed for some of the
  moths formerly included in the genus <i>Micropteryx</i>.<a id="NtA_339"
  href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> They are small, brilliant, metallic Insects, of diurnal
  habits, but are very rarely seen on the wing, and it is doubtful whether they can fly much. These
  little Insects are of peculiar interest, inasmuch as they differ from the great majority of the
  Lepidoptera in at least two very important points, viz. the structure of the wings and of the
  mouth-parts. The mouth shows that we may consider that the Lepidoptera belong to the mandibulate
  Insects, although in the great majority of them the mandibles in the final instar are
  insignificant, functionless structures, or are entirely absent, and although the maxillae are so
  highly adapted for the tasting of sweets that it is difficult to recognise in them the parts
  usually found in the maxilla of mandibulate Insects.</p>

  <p><i>Eriocephala</i> in both these respects connects the Lepidoptera with Mandibulata: the
  mandibles have been shown by Walter<a id="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> to be
  fairly well developed; and the maxillae are not developed into a proboscis, but have each two
  separate, differentiated&mdash;not elongated&mdash;lobes, and an elongate, five-jointed, very
  flexible palpus. The moths feed on pollen, and use their maxillae for the purpose, somewhat in the
  style we have mentioned in Prodoxidae. The wings have no frenulum, neither have they any shoulder,
  and they probably function as separate organs instead of as a united pair on each side: the
  modification of the anterior parts of the hind wing&mdash;whereby this wing is reduced as a flying
  agent to the condition of a subordinate to the front wing&mdash;does not here exist: the hind wing
  differs little from the front wing in consequence of the parts in front of the cell being well
  developed. There is a small jugum. These characters have led Packard to suggest that the
  Eriocephalidae should be separated from all other Lepidoptera to form a distinct sub-Order,
  Lepidoptera Laciniata.<a id="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> The wing-characters of
  <i>Eriocephala</i> are repeated&mdash;as to their main features&mdash;in Hepialidae and
  Micropterygidae; but both these groups differ from <i>Eriocephala</i> as to the structure of the
  mouth-parts, and in their metamorphoses. Although <i>Eriocephala calthella</i> is one of our most
  abundant moths, occurring in the spring nearly everywhere, and being easily found on account of
  its habit of sitting in buttercup-flowers, yet its metamorphoses were till recently completely
  unknown. Dr. Chapman has, however, been able to give us some information as to the habits and
  structure of the larvae, in both of which points the creature is most interesting. The eggs and
  young larvae are "quite <span class="pagenum" id="page435"><span
  class="smaller">{435}</span></span>unlike our ideas of a Lepidopterous Insect;" the former have a
  snowy or mealy appearance, owing to a close coating of minute rods standing vertically on the
  surface of the egg, and often tipped with a small bulb. The larva lives amongst wet moss and feeds
  on the growing parts thereof; it is not very similar to any other Lepidopterous larva: Dr. Chapman
  suggests a similarity to the Slug-worms (Limacodids), but Dyar is probably correct in thinking the
  resemblances between the two are unimportant: the larva of <i>Eriocephala</i> possesses three
  pairs of thoracic legs, and eight pairs of abdominal appendages, placed on the segments
  immediately following the thorax; on the under-surface of the ninth and tenth abdominal segments
  there is a sucker, trifoliate in form; this is probably really situate entirely on the tenth
  segment: the body bears rows of ball-appendages, and the integument is beautifully sculptured. The
  head is retractile and the antennae are longer than is usual in caterpillars. This larva is
  profoundly different from other Lepidopterous larvae inasmuch as the abdominal feet, or
  appendages, are placed on different segments to what is customary, and are of a different form.
  Unfortunately the pupa has not been procured, but there is some reason for supposing that it will
  prove to be more like that of Tineidae than like that of Micropterygidae.</p>

  <p>The New Zealand genus <i>Palaeomicra</i> is only imperfectly known. Meyrick considers it the
  "most ancient" Lepidopteron yet discovered; and it would appear that its relations are with
  <i>Eriocephala</i> rather than with <i>Micropteryx</i>. From information he has kindly given to
  us, we are able to say that this moth possesses mandibles but no proboscis.</p>

  <p>There are no mandibles, but there is a short, imperfect proboscis. Larva (Fig. 210) without any
  legs, mining in leaves. The pupa (Fig. 211) is not a pupa obtecta, but has the head and appendages
  free, and is provided with enormous mandibles. Although these Insects in general appearance
  resemble <i>Eriocephala</i> to such an extent that both have been placed in one genus, viz.
  <i>Micropteryx</i>, yet the two forms are radically distinct. The most remarkable point in
  <i>Micropteryx</i> is the metamorphosis; the female moth is furnished with a cutting ovipositor,
  by the aid of which she deposits an egg between the two layers of a leaf after the manner of a
  saw-fly;<a id="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> the larva mines the newly-opened
  leaves in the early spring, and feeds up with rapidity; it by some means reaches the ground, and
  there pupates in a firm but thin cocoon, with grains of earth fastened to it; in this it passes
  the greater part of its life as a larva, changing to a pupa very early in the following spring.
  The pupa is unlike any other Lepidopterous pupa, but is similar to those of Trichoptera; neither
  the head nor the appendages are glued to the body or to one another, but are free, so that the
  pupa can use the appendages to a considerable extent; it is furnished with enormous mandibles
  (Fig. 211, C, D), which are detached and shed after emergence.<a id="NtA_343"
  href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> In the interval between <span class="pagenum"
  id="page437"><span class="smaller">{437}</span></span>the larval period of feeding and the
  imaginal instar, the phenomena of life are essentially like those of Trichoptera. The larva has
  not been at all satisfactorily studied; the spiracles appear to be excessively minute, but have
  been ascertained by Dr. Chapman to be normal in number and position.</p>

  <p class="sp5">All the information we possess points to profound distinctions between
  <i>Micropteryx</i> and <i>Eriocephala</i>, for whereas in the former the mandibles drop off from
  the pupa, so that the imago has no mandibles, in the latter the mandibles exist, as they do in
  several other true Lepidoptera. As the history of the mandibles is not known in other Lepidoptera
  (where they are present in the larva but wanting in the imago), it is premature to conclude that
  no other Lepidoptera suffer the actual loss of the mandibles as <i>Micropteryx</i> does, though
  there is nothing to lead us to believe that in any other Lepidopterous pupa are the mandibles
  specially developed as they are in <i>Micropteryx</i>. This pupa is in fact quite unique in this
  Order of Insects. When the history of the pupal mandibles is known, we shall be able to decide
  whether they are secondary structures, like the deciduous, supplementary mandibles found in
  Otiorhynchides (Coleoptera, Rhynchophora).</p>

    large mass. Mouth-parts very variable, formed for suction not for biting, frequently assuming

    head. The metamorphosis is very great, the larvae bearing no resemblance whatever to the perfect
    Insects, but being usually footless grubs or maggots; frequently the head is indistinct, small,
    and retracted. Pupa variable, either exposed and rather hard, with the appendages of the body
    more or less adherent; or enclosed in a scaly capsule looking like a seed, and when extracted,

  <p>This definition of the Diptera, or two-winged flies, is framed without reference to the fleas,
  which are wingless, or to a few other parasitic wingless Diptera, such as the sheep-tick. Although
  the Order is of enormous extent, these exceptional cases are remarkably few. About 40,000 species
  of Diptera have been discovered, but these are only a tithe of what are still unknown to science.
  The Order is not a favourite one with entomologists, and by the rest of the world it may be said
  to be detested. Flies do not display the sort of intelligence we appreciate, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page439"><span class="smaller">{439}</span></span>or the kind of beauty we admire, and as a
  few of the creatures somewhat annoy us, the whole Order is only too frequently included in the
  category of nuisances that we must submit to. Moreover, the scavenger-habits that are revealed,
  when we begin to study their lives, are very repugnant to many persons. It is therefore no wonder
  that flies are not popular, and that few are willing to study them, or to collect them for
  observation. Nevertheless, Diptera have considerable claims to be classed as actually the highest
  of Insects physiologically, for it is certainly in them that the processes of a complete
  life-history are carried on with the greatest rapidity and that the phenomena of metamorphosis
  have been most perfected. A maggot, hatching from an egg, is able to grow with such rapidity that
  the work of its life in this respect is completed in a few days; then forming an impenetrable skin
  it dissolves itself almost completely; solidifying subsequently to a sort of jelly, it in a few
  days reconstructs itself as a being of totally different appearance and habits, in all its
  structures so profoundly changed from what it was that the resources of science are severely taxed
  to demonstrate any identity of the organs of the two instars.</p>

  <p>A good study of the comparative anatomy of Diptera has never been made; Baron Osten Sacken, one
  of our most accomplished Dipterologists, has recently stated that "the external characters of the
  Diptera have as yet been very insufficiently studied." We shall therefore only trouble the student
  with a few observations on points of structure that are of special importance, or that he will
  find frequently alluded to. The head is remarkable <span class="pagenum" id="page440"><span
  class="smaller">{440}</span></span>for its mobility, and is connected with the thorax by a slender
  concealed neck that permits the head to undergo semi-rotation. A large part&mdash;sometimes nearly
  the whole&mdash;of the exposed surface of the head is occupied by the faceted eyes. It is usually
  the case that the eyes are larger in the male than in the female, and the sexual discrepancy in
  this respect may be very great. When the eyes of the two sides meet in a coadapted line of union
  the Insect is said to be "holoptic," and when the eyes are well separated "dichoptic."<a
  id="NtA_344" href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> The holoptic condition is specially
  characteristic of the male, but in some forms occurs in both sexes. There is no definite
  distinction between holoptic and dichoptic eyes. The eyes may be enormous, Fig. 238, without
  actually uniting, and in the cases where actual contiguity occurs, it takes place in different
  manners.<a id="NtA_345" href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> The eyes are frequently during life of
  brilliant colours and variegate with stripes or spots; this condition disappears speedily after
  death, and it is uncertain what the use of this coloration may be.<a id="NtA_346"
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> The eyes are frequently densely set with hairs between the
  almost innumerable facets. These facets frequently differ in size according to their position in
  the organ. The curious double eye of the male <i>Bibio</i> (cf. Fig. 224) is well worth notice.
  There are usually three small ocelli placed very near together on the middle of the summit of the
  head.</p>

  <p>The antennae are of considerable importance, as they offer one of the readiest means of
  classification. The families placed by systematists at the commencement of the Order have antennae
  similar to those of the majority of Insects, inasmuch as they consist of a series of segments
  approximately similar to one another, and arranged in a linear manner (Fig. 213, A). The number of
  these joints is never very great, but reaches sixteen in certain Tipulidae, and falls as low as
  eight in some Bibionidae. In certain cases where the antennae of the male are densely feathered
  (<i>Chironomus</i>, e.g.), the number of joints is in that sex greatly augmented, but they are
  imperfectly separated. This form of antenna gives the name Nemocera to the first series of
  Diptera.</p>

  <p>The majority of flies have antennae of another form, peculiar to the Order, viz. three
  segments, the outer one of which is of diverse form, according to the genus or species, and bears
  on its front a fine projecting bristle, frequently feathered, as in Fig. 213, F; and often
  distinctly divided into two or more joints. This form of antenna is found in the series Aschiza
  and Schizophora; it is well exemplified in the common house-fly, where the organs in question hang
  from the forehead, and are placed in a hollow formed for their reception on the front of the head.
  Flies with this form of antennae are called Athericerous. Between the two forms of antennae we
  have mentioned there exists what may, speaking roughly, be called an intermediate condition, or
  rather a variety of intermediate conditions, associated in the series Brachycera (Fig. 213, B to
  D).<a id="NtA_347" href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> Here there are three (sometimes one or two)
  segments and a terminal appendage, but the appendage is usually compound (often so distinctly

  213, B): the appendage in these cases is terminal, that is to say it is placed, not as in the
  Eumyiidae on the front of the joint that bears it, but (in the great majority of Brachycera) at
  the tip thereof; this appendage is often conical and pointed, often hair-like. Exceptional forms
  of antenna are found in the parasitic flies of the series Pupipara. In the Order generally the two
  basal joints of the antennae are evidently distinct in function from the others, and form the
  "scape"; the <span class="pagenum" id="page442"><span class="smaller">{442}</span></span>part of
  the antenna beyond the scape is called the "flagellum"; an appendage of the flagellum is called
  "arista" when bristle-like, when thicker "style." In the basal joint of the antenna there is a
  complex nervous structure known as Johnston's organ. It is specially well developed in
  <i>Culex</i> and <i>Chironomus</i>, and is larger in the male than it is in the female. Child has
  found something of the kind present in all the Diptera he has examined, and he considers that an
  analogous structure exists in Insects of other Orders. He thinks it is concerned with the
  perception of vibration, there being no sharp distinction between auditory and tactile
  sensation.<a id="NtA_348" href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

  <p>About one-half of the Diptera possess a peculiar structure in the form of a head-vesicle called
  "ptilinum." In the fly emerging from the pupa this appears as a bladder-like expansion of the
  front of the head; being susceptible of great distension, it is useful in rupturing the hard shell
  in which the creature is then enclosed. In the mature fly the ptilinum is completely introverted,
  and can be found only by dissection; a little space, the "lunula," just under an arched suture,
  extending over the point of insertion of the antennae remains, however, and offers evidence of the
  existence of the ptilinum. This structure is also of importance in classification, though,
  unfortunately, it is difficult to verify.<a id="NtA_349" href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

  <p>No point of Insect morphology has given rise to more difference of opinion than the mouth of
  Diptera; and the subject is still very far from being completely understood. The anatomy and
  morphology of the mandibulate Insect-mouth are comparatively simple (though not without greater
  difficulties than are usually appreciated); and it has been the desire of morphologists to
  homologise the sucking mouth of Diptera with the biting mouth; hence the view that the appendages
  of three segments are separate and distinct in the fly's mouth is taken for granted, and it is
  further assumed that some of the secondary parts of the appendages of the biting mouth can also be
  recognised in the sucking mouth. The anatomy of the mouth-parts is, however, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page443"><span class="smaller">{443}</span></span>subject to great diversity of structure
  within the limits of the Order itself, even the two sexes in some species differing profoundly in
  this respect.<a id="NtA_350" href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> In the majority of the family
  Oestridae the mouth-parts are practically absent, and no definite entry to the alimentary canal
  can be perceived (Fig. 245). Besides this condition and its antithesis (Fig. 214), the complex
  assemblage of lancets seen in the Breeze-flies that draw blood, there is a great variety of other
  anatomical conditions.</p>

  <p>Although, as we have said, great diversity of opinion exists, yet on the whole the majority of
  Dipterologists accept a view something to the following effect:&mdash;the labrum, or the labrum
  combined with the epipharynx, is frequently much prolonged; the tongue&mdash;hypopharynx&mdash;may
  also be much prolonged, and may form, in apposition with the labrum, a more or less imperfect tube
  for ingestion of the nutriment; the labium is more or less membranous or fleshy, and acts as a
  sheathing organ, its tips&mdash;called labella&mdash;-being in some cases developed to a quite
  extraordinary extent. As to the other parts of the mouth there is less agreement; the pointed
  organs (Fig. 214, A, <i>b</i> <i>b</i>) are by <span class="pagenum" id="page444"><span
  class="smaller">{444}</span></span>many identified as mandibles, while another pair of pointed
  processes (<i>c</i> <i>c</i>) are considered to be parts of a maxilla, and the palpi (<i>f</i>
  <i>f</i>) are by some considered to be maxillary palps. The Danish entomologist, Meinert, has
  published the best anatomical description of many of the diverse kinds of Dipterous mouth.<a
  id="NtA_351" href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> He, however, takes a different view of the
  morphology; he considers that not only may parts of the appendages of the mouth be much modified
  during the early stages of the individual development, but that they may be differently combined,
  even parts of the appendages of two segments being brought together in intimate combination. He
  has also pointed out that the mandibulate and sucking mouth are mechanical implements constructed
  on opposed principles; the main object of a biting mouth being the fixing and perfecting of the
  articulations of the mouth, so that great power of holding may be attained with a limited but
  definite power of movement. In the sucking mouth the parts are intimately associated for simple
  protrusion. Hence the two kinds of mouth must have been distinguished very early in the phylogeny,
  so that we must not expect to find a great correspondence between the parts of biting and sucking
  mouths. He apparently also considers that not only the appendages of a head-segment, but also part
  of the body of the segment, may be used in the construction of the mouth-organs. Meinert's views
  allow a much greater latitude of interpretation of the parts of the Dipterous mouth; had he
  contented himself with enunciating them in the manner we have followed him in summarily
  describing, they would have been recognised as a formidable obstacle to the facile adoption of the
  ordinary views. He has, however, accompanied his general statement with a particular
  interpretation and a distinct nomenclature, neither of which is it possible to adopt at present,
  as they have no more justification than the ordinary view. So that instead of one set of doubtful
  interpretations we have two.<a id="NtA_352" href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a> In so difficult a
  question as homologising the trophi of different Orders of Insects we ought to use <span
  class="pagenum" id="page445"><span class="smaller">{445}</span></span>exhaustively every method of
  inquiry: and from this point of view the development is of great importance. This has, however, as
  yet thrown but little light on the subject, this study being a very difficult one owing to the
  profound changes that take place during metamorphosis, the diversity of the parts in the early
  stages of Diptera, and the possibility that the larval conditions may themselves have been greatly
  changed in the course of the phylogeny. Miall informs us, however, that in <i>Chironomus</i> as
  well as in <i>Corethra</i> the new parts of the mouth of the imago are developed within those of
  the larva.<a id="NtA_353" href="#Nt_353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> This may permit of an identification
  of the main divisions of the mouth, at any rate in these cases. Lowne has to some extent traced
  the development in the blowfly, and he does not agree with the usual interpretation of the parts
  in the adult.</p>

  <p>The mouth is of considerable importance in the classification of Diptera. The Nemocera are
  remarkable from the linear development and flexibility of the palpi, which are nearly always at
  least three- or four-jointed; this condition occurring in no other Diptera. The palpi attain an
  extraordinary development in some Culicidae; in the genus <i>Megarrhina</i> they are nearly as
  long as the body, and project in front of the head after the fashion of the palpi of Lepidoptera.
  In the Brachycera the sclerites or hard parts of the mouth reach a maximum of development, and in
  Tabanidae (Fig. 214), Nemestrinidae and Bombyliidae are often quite disproportionate to the size
  of the Insect. In many of the Eumyiid flies the soft parts are greatly developed, and capable of a
  variety of movement, the proboscis as a whole being protrusible, and having an elbow-joint in the
  middle.</p>

  <p>The thorax is remarkable from the absence of distinct separation into the three divisions that
  may usually be so easily distinguished in Insects. The perfect combination of the three segments
  adds much to the difficulty of arriving at general conclusions as to the identification of the
  parts; hence considerable difference of opinion still prevails. It was formerly supposed that a
  segment from the abdomen was added to the thorax of Diptera as it is in Hymenoptera, but this has
  been shown by Brauer to be erroneous. Indeed, according to Lowne, the abdominal cavity is
  increased by the addition of the small posterior area of the thorax; it being the mesophragma that
  separates the <span class="pagenum" id="page446"><span class="smaller">{446}</span></span>second
  and third great divisions of the body-cavity. The prothorax is always small, except in a few of
  the abnormal wingless forms (<i>Melophagus</i>); in <i>Nycteribia</i> (Fig. 248) the mesothorax
  forms the anterior part of the body; the head and such parts of the prothorax as may be
  subsequently discovered to exist being placed entirely on the dorsum of the body. The mesothorax
  in all the winged Diptera forms by far the larger portion of the thoracic mass, the prominent part
  of it, that projects backwards to a greater or less extent over the base of the abdomen, being the
  scutellum. The first or prothoracic stigma is remarkably large and distinct, and is by some called
  mesothoracic. Another large stigma is placed very near to the halter (or balancer); the metathorax
  being very small. An imperfect stigma is said by Lowne to exist in the blowfly near the base of
  the wing. The number of abdominal segments externally visible is very diverse; there may be as
  many as nine (in the male <i>Tipula</i>), or as few as five, or even four, when the basal segment
  is much concealed; the diminution is due to certain segments at the extremity being indrawn and
  serving as a sort of tubular ovipositor in the female, or curled under the body and altered in
  form in the other sex, so as to constitute what is called a "hypopygium." In the female of
  Tipulidae the body is terminated by some horny pieces forming an external ovipositor. In nearly
  all Diptera the feet are five-jointed; the claws are well developed, there being placed under each
  of them a free pad or membrane, the "pulvillus"; there may be also a median structure between each
  pair of claws, of diverse form, the "empodium."</p>

  <p>On the surface of the body of many flies there will be seen an armature of pointed bristles;
  these flies are called "chaetophorous"; where no regularly arranged system of such bristles exists
  the fly is "eremochaetous." In some families the arrangement of these bristles is of importance in
  classification, and a system of description has been drawn up by Baron Osten Sacken: this branch
  of descriptive entomology is known as chaetotaxy.<a id="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The wings are of great importance in classifying Diptera; but unfortunately, like the other
  parts, they have not received an exhaustive anatomical study, and Dipterologists are not agreed as
  to the names that should be applied to their parts.</p>

  </div>

  <p>We give below figures of two systems that have been used by eminent Dipterologists for the
  description of the nervures and cells. The comprehension of these features of the Dipterous wing
  will be facilitated by noticing that the wing&mdash;being extended at right angles to the
  body&mdash;is divided by the longitudinal nervures into two great fields, anterior and posterior,
  with an interval between them: this interval is traversed only by a short cross-vein (marked x in
  Fig. 215 A, and i in B). This cross-vein may be placed near the base or nearer to the tip of the
  wing; it is of importance because no nervure in front of the median area traversed by it can
  correspond with a nervure placed behind it in another wing. The very different nature of the
  nervuration in the two wings we have figured will readily be appreciated by an inspection of the
  parts posterior to the little cross-vein. On the hind margin of the wing, near the base, there is
  often a more or less free lobe (Fig. 215, B, O) called the "alula": still nearer to the base, or
  placed on the side of the body, may be seen one or two other lobes, of which the one nearer the
  alula is called the "tegula," or (when a lobe behind it is also present) the "upper tegula," (the
  "antitegula" of Osten Sacken); the other being the "lower tegula." These two terms are erroneous,
  the word tegula being definitely applied to another part of the Insect-body. In speaking of this
  structure in the following pages, we have preferred to call it the <span class="pagenum"

  href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> Those Muscidae in which the squama covers the halter like a
  hood are called "calypterate." In Fig. 216, we represent these structures, and in the explanation
  have mentioned the synonyms. The terms we think most applicable to the three lobes are alula,
  antisquama, squama. The squama may be called "calypter" when it covers the halter.</p>

  <p>The halteres&mdash;commonly called balancers or poisers&mdash;are perhaps the most
  characteristic of all the Dipterous structures, though they are absent in most of the few wingless
  forms of the Order. Outside the Diptera similar organs appear to exist only in male Coccidae. The
  pair of halteres is placed on the metathorax, one on each of the pleural regions. They are
  believed to be the homologues of the hind wings; Weinland states<a id="NtA_356"
  href="#Nt_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a> that certain canals existing in the interior of the halter
  correspond to wing-nervures. The halter may be described as a small rod-like body with a head like
  a pin, this terminal part being, however, rather variable in form. We have already stated that in
  many Diptera the squama forms a hood, the position of which leads to the belief that it is an
  important adjunct to the halter. Although the exact functions of the halteres are far from clear,
  it is certain that they are highly complex bodies, of extremely delicate structure: they are
  doubtless sense-organs, possessing as they do, groups of papillae on the exterior and a
  chordotonal organ (a structure for assisting the perception of sound) in the basal part; each
  halter is provided with four muscles at the base, and can, like the wings, execute most rapid
  vibrations. Seeing that they are the homologues of wings, it is a remarkable fact that in no
  Diptera are they replaced by wings, or by structures intermediate between these two kinds of
  organs.</p>

  <p><b>Internal Structure.</b>&mdash;Information about the internal anatomy <span class="pagenum"
  id="page449"><span class="smaller">{449}</span></span>is by no means extensive. The tracheal
  system is highly developed, and has air-sacs connected with it; a large pair at the base of the
  abdomen being called a&euml;rostats by Dufour. Inside the thoracic spiracles there are peculiar
  structures supposed by some to be voice-organs, while the abdominal spiracles are said to be
  remarkably simple in structure. Lowne says that there are ten or eleven pairs of spiracles in the
  Blow-fly; one of these, near the base of the wing, is peculiar in structure, and may not be a true
  stigma; he calls it a tympanic spiracle; it seems doubtful whether there are more than seven
  abdominal pairs. The alimentary canal is very elongate, and is provided with a diverticulum, the
  crop; this is usually called the sucking stomach, though its function is extremely doubtful. The
  Malpighian tubes are four in number, and are very elongate; in several groups of Nemocera there
  are, however, five Malpighian tubes, a number known to occur in only very few other Insects. The
  nervous system is remarkable on account of the concentration of ganglia in the thorax, so as to
  form a thoracic, in addition to the usual cephalic, brain. For particulars as to the positions of
  the ganglia and the great changes that occur in the lifetime, the student should refer to Brandt,
  to K&uuml;nckel, and to Brauer.<a id="NtA_357" href="#Nt_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> Much information as
  to the internal anatomy of the Blowfly is given by Lowne, but it is doubtful to what extent it is

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <b>larvae</b> of Diptera are&mdash;so far as the unaided eye is concerned&mdash;without
  exception destitute of any kind of adornment, the vast majority of them being of the kind known as
  maggots. None of them have true thoracic legs; though in the earlier groups, pseudopods or
  protuberances of the body that serve as aids in locomotion are common. Unlike what occurs in other
  Orders the arrangement of these pseudopods on the body differs greatly in various forms; in a few
  cases they are surmounted by <span class="pagenum" id="page450"><span
  class="smaller">{450}</span></span>curved hairs. The most important distinction in external form
  in Dipterous larvae is that while those that are thorough maggots possess no visible head, others
  have a well-marked one (Fig. 225); these are therefore called "eucephalous": they have a mouth of
  the mandibulate type. In some other Dipterous larvae the head is more or less reduced in size, and
  in the acephalous forms there is only a framework of a few chitinous rods to represent it. The
  nervous system in the most completely headless larvae is very remarkable, all the ganglia being
  concentrated in a single mass placed in the thorax. The tracheal system exhibits a great variety;
  some larvae have stigmata arranged along the sides of the body after the fashion normal in
  Insect-larvae; these are called "peripneustic"; as many as ten pairs of stigmata may be present in
  these cases, but nine pairs is much more common. Other larvae have a pair of stigmata placed at
  the termination of the body, and another pair near the anterior extremity, the two pairs
  communicating by large tracheal trunks extending the length of the body; these larvae are said to
  be "amphipneustic": this is the condition usual in the more completely acephalous larvae. Others
  have only the terminal pair of spiracles, and are styled "metapneustic." Some begin life in the
  metapneustic state and afterwards become amphipneustic. In the aquatic larva of <i>Corethra</i>
  there are no spiracles, though there is an imperfect tracheal system. Many Dipterous larvae that
  live in water or in conditions that prevent access of air to the body have remarkable arrangements
  for keeping the tip of the body in communication with the atmosphere. The stigmata in metapneustic
  and amphipneustic larvae are very remarkable compound structures, exhibiting however great
  diversity; their peculiarities and uses are not well understood; it appears very doubtful whether
  some of them have any external opening. Reference may be made, as to the variety of structure, to
  Meijere's paper<a id="NtA_359" href="#Nt_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a> from which we take the
  accompanying figure of a posterior stigmatic apparatus in <i>Lipara lucens</i>. It appears that
  there is a compound chamber&mdash;"Filzkammer"&mdash;terminating externally in lobes or
  fingers&mdash;"Knospen" and appearing as marks on the outer surface: this chamber is seated on a
  tracheal tube, and is, Meijere thinks, probably a secondary growth of the trachea coming to the
  outer surface. It is traversed by what may be <span class="pagenum" id="page451"><span
  class="smaller">{451}</span></span>considered the original tracheal tube, opening externally as an
  external stigmatic scar&mdash;"Stigmennarbe"&mdash;and with a second or inner scar placed
  internally. We may conclude from what is already known that these structures will be found to
  differ in the same larva according to the stage of its development.</p>

  <p>An extremely valuable summary of the characters and variety of Dipterous larvae has been given
  by Brauer,<a id="NtA_360" href="#Nt_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a> from which it appears that the
  larvae of the first half of the family exhibit great variety and have been much studied, while the
  more purely maggot-like forms of the Muscidae have, with one or two exceptions, been little
  investigated.</p>

  <p>The <b>pupal</b> instar is of two distinct kinds. First, we meet with a pupa like that of
  Lepidoptera, viz. a mummy-like object, or pupa obtecta, in which there is a crisp outer shell,
  formed in part by the adherent cases of the appendages of the future imago. This condition, with a
  few exceptions to be subsequently noticed, obtains in the Nemocera and Brachycera. It is exhibited
  in various degrees of perfection, being most complete in Tipulidae; in other forms the shell is
  softer and the appendages more protuberant. The second kind of pupa is found in the Cyclorrhaphous
  flies; it has externally no marks except some faint circular rings and, frequently, a pair of
  projections from near one extremity of the body; occasionally there is a single prominence at the
  other extremity of the body. This condition is due to the fact that the larva does not escape from
  the skin at the last ecdysis, but merely shrinks within it, so that the larval skin, itself
  contracted and altered by an excretion of chitin, remains and forms a perfect protection to the
  included organism. This kind of pupa looks like a seed, and is well exemplified by the common
  Blow-fly. The capacity for entering on such a condition is evidently correlative with the absence
  of a larval head. The metamorphosis in this curious little barrel goes on in a different manner to
  what it does in the pupa <span class="pagenum" id="page452"><span
  class="smaller">{452}</span></span>obtecta. A good name for the whole structure of this instar has
  not been found. Older authors called it "pupa coarctata," or "nympha inclusa"; Brauer speaks of it
  as a "compound pupa"; ordinarily in our language it is called a "puparium," a term which is more
  applicable to the case alone.</p>

  <p>In species having a pupa obtecta the larval skin is cast after the chief processes of the
  external metamorphosis have occurred, and then an exudation of chitin hardens the general surface.
  In the "compound pupa" of the Blow-fly there is for a considerable period no formed pupa at all,
  but merely a shell or case containing the results of histolysis and the centres for regeneration
  of new organs; the chitin-exudation to the exterior of the larval skin occurs in the early part of
  the series of metamorphic changes, and the organism breaks down to a cream within the shell thus
  formed, and then gradually assumes therein the condition of a soft, nymphoid pupa. The exceptional
  conditions previously referred to as exhibited by a few forms are certain cases in which a more or
  less perfect pupa obtecta is found within the last larval skin, as is the case in
  <i>Stratiomys</i>. Another highly remarkable condition exists in the Hessian fly, and a few other
  Cecidomyiids, where the Insect apparently makes an exudation which it uses as a covering case,
  independent of the larval skin; this latter being subsequently shed inside the case, so that this
  condition of coarctate pupa differs from that we have described as existing in Cyclorrhaphous
  flies, although the two are superficially similar. In the Pupipara the larval stage is passed in
  the body of the mother, which produces a succession of young, nourished one at a time by the
  secretion of glands; this young is born as a full-grown larva that becomes at once a pupa.</p>

  <p><b>Metamorphosis.</b>&mdash;As it is in Diptera that the phenomena of Insect-metamorphosis have
  reached their highest development we endeavoured to give some idea of their nature in the previous
  volume, therefore we need give only a brief sketch of the chief features of Dipterous
  metamorphosis. The Blow-fly undergoes a rapid embryonic development, the later stages of which
  are, on the whole, of a retrogressive nature. On the emergence of the young maggot it feeds up
  rapidly, the rapidity varying greatly according to circumstances, and then when full-grown rests.
  While resting, a process of internal liquefaction, called histolysis, is going on, and the maggot
  contracts and exudes an excretion <span class="pagenum" id="page453"><span
  class="smaller">{453}</span></span>that hardens its skin. At the time this hard skin has become
  complete, or soon after, the maggot inside has dissolved into a cream contained in a sac inside
  the shell; this cream becomes reconstituted into a fly by a gradual process of growth and
  development of certain minute portions of the body&mdash;the imaginal discs or folds, the
  histoblasts and neuroblasts that were exempt from the histolytic process: in the early stages of
  the reconstitution the general structure is, of course, altogether vague, and this
  condition&mdash;purely one of transition&mdash;is called the pronymph; the nymph becomes gradually
  developed: it corresponds vaguely with the pupa obtecta of the early groups of Diptera, but is
  soft like the pupa of Hymenoptera. This nymph gradually develops into the fly itself, the external
  parts being first completed and the internal organs elaborated subsequently. The sexual organs do
  not undergo metamorphosis like other internal organs, there being a gradual (though irregular or
  interrupted) growth of them in the young larva, till they are completed some time after the
  emergence of the perfect fly. The processes in the Blow-fly have been studied by numerous able
  histologists of various nationalities, and have recently been described by Lowne in our own
  language.<a id="NtA_361" href="#Nt_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a> Comparatively little has been done in
  studying the corresponding phenomena in other Diptera. Weismann has investigated the development
  of <i>Corethra</i>, and Miall that of <i>Chironomus</i>. These two flies belong to a division of
  Diptera different from that which includes the Blow-fly, and they display a condition of the
  metamorphic processes allied to what occurs in Lepidoptera, as well as to that which takes place
  in the Blow-fly. Imaginal folds are formed, but they only appear much later in the life, and they
  are much less distant from the positions they will, when developed, occupy in the imago. In
  <i>Chironomus</i>, according to Miall, the imaginal folds only appear in the last larval instar,
  but they grow with such rapidity that the legs and wings of the future fly can be distinguished in
  the larva, even before pupation; thus when the activity of the larva ceases but little change is
  required to complete the obtected pupa. In the Blow-fly some of the imaginal folds have been <span
  class="pagenum" id="page454"><span class="smaller">{454}</span></span>traced back to the embryo;
  how many centres for the new growth there may be is uncertain, for though there are upwards of
  sixty for the outer body, the number of regenerative centres for the internal organs is not
  ascertained. The peculiar central nervous mass, mentioned in our remarks on the larva, consists of
  two kinds of tissue mixed together in a complex manner; one of these kinds is functionally active
  during the larval life and at the metamorphosis undergoes histolysis, while the other, or
  embryonic, portion develops into the nervous system of the fly.</p>

  <p>It forms no part of our task to deal with general subjects, but we may be pardoned for calling
  attention to the bearing the metamorphosis of the higher Diptera has on our ideas of heredity in
  Insects. The fly bears no resemblance whatever to the larva, and is only obtained by the organic
  destruction of the latter, which occurs before the perfection of the sexual organs takes place,
  and yet the fly reproduces itself only secondarily, but primarily gives rise to the totally
  different larva. It is supposed that the larval structures have been gradually acquired, and yet
  they are transmitted with the utmost faithfulness by the totally different fly. We can only
  conclude that that which is bequeathed in each species is the early state of a particular process
  of development from which the subsequent stages follow necessarily if the developing organism be
  placed in conditions having on it influences like to those that influenced the ancestors.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The classification of Diptera is as yet very imperfect. Formerly
  they were divided into two great groups, Nemocera and Brachycera, according to the structure of
  the antennae, as previously mentioned. This division has been abandoned, and the term Brachycera
  is now applied to only a small part of the old section that bore the name. The primary division
  usually adopted at present is into Orthorrhapha and Cyclorrhapha. The characters of these two
  groups are based on the nature of the metamorphosis, and have been gradually elaborated by Brauer
  in various memoirs.<a id="NtA_362" href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> The Orthorrhapha includes
  the forms with obtected pupae, the Cyclorrhapha those with a nymph-compound, as previously
  described. This distinction is of great importance, but unfortunately it is difficult to apply to
  the fly itself; the only character that can be used in <span class="pagenum" id="page455"><span
  class="smaller">{455}</span></span>connection with the imago is the existence of a suture over the
  insertion of the antennae in a portion, but not all, of the Cyclorrhapha.<a id="NtA_363"
  href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a> The next set of divisions used by Brauer divides the Order
  into four sections, viz. 1. Orthorrhapha Nematocera, 2. O. Brachycera, 3. Cyclorrhapha Aschiza, 4.
  C. Schizophora. As these four groups are recognised more readily than the two major groups the
  student will do well at first to disregard the primary division and consider the Diptera as
  divisible into four great groups. To these four divisions we, however, add temporarily a fifth,
  viz. Pupipara. This is included by Brauer in Schizophora, but it appears to be really an unnatural
  complex, and had better be kept separate till it has been entirely reconsidered. These great
  sections may be thus summarised<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>Series 1. <i>Orthorrhapha Nemocera.</i>&mdash;Antennae with more than 6 segments, not
    terminated by an arista; with the segments of the flagellum more or less similar to one another.
    Palpi slender and flexible, four- or five-jointed.<a id="NtA_364"
    href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>
    <p>Series 2. <i>Orthorrhapha Brachycera.</i>&mdash;Antennae variable, but never truly Nemocerous
    nor like those of Cyclorrhapha; when an arista is present it is usually placed terminally, not
    superiorly; when an arista is not present the flagellum terminates as an appendage consisting of
    a variable number of indistinctly separated segments; thus the flagellum is not composed of
    similar joints; [rarely are the antennae as many as seven-jointed]. Palpi only one- or
    two-jointed.<a id="NtA_365" href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> Around the insertion of the
    antennae there is no definite arched suture enclosing a small depressed space. The nervuration
    of the wings is usually more complex than in any of the other divisions.</p>
    <p>Series 3. <i>Cyclorrhapha Aschiza.</i>&mdash;Antennae composed of not more than three joints
    and an arista; the latter is not terminal. Front of head without definite arched suture over the
    antennae, but frequently with a minute area of different colour or texture there. This group
    consists of the great family Syrphidae, and of four small families, viz. Conopidae,
    Pipunculidae, Phoridae, and Platypezidae. The section is supposed to be justified by its being
    Cyclorrhaphous in pupation, and by the members not possessing a ptilinum (or having no trace of
    one when quite mature). The Syrphidae are doubtless <span class="pagenum" id="page456"><span
    class="smaller">{456}</span></span>a natural group, but the association with them of the other
    families mentioned is a mere temporary device. The greatest difficulty is experienced in
    deciding on a position for Phoridae, as to which scarcely any two authorities are agreed.</p>
    <p>Series 4. <i>Cyclorrhapha Schizophora</i>, or Eumyiid flies. The antennae consist of three
    joints and an arista. In the Calyptratae the frontal suture, or fold over the antennae, is well
    marked and extends downwards along each side of the face, leaving a distinct lunule over the
    antennae. In the Acalyptrate Muscids the form of the head and of the antennae vary much and are
    less characteristic, but the wings differ from those of Brachycera by their much less complex
    nervuration.</p>
    <p>Series 5. <i>Pupipara.</i> These are flies of abnormal habits, and only found in connection
    with living Vertebrates, of which they suck the blood (one species, <i>Braula caeca</i>, lives
    on bees). Many are wingless, or have wings reduced in size. The young are produced alive, full
    grown, but having still to undergo a metamorphosis. This group consists of a small number of
    flies of which some are amongst the most aberrant known. This is specially the case with the
    Nycteribiidae. This Section will probably be greatly modified, as it is far from being a natural
    assemblage.<a id="NtA_366" href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>
    <p class="sp0">The Sub-Order <i>Aphaniptera</i>, or Fleas, considered a distinct Order by many
    entomologists, may for the present be placed as a part of Diptera.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It must be admitted that these sections are far from satisfactory. Brauer divides them into
  Tribes, based on the nature of the larvae, but these tribes are even more unsatisfactory than the
  sections, hosts of species being entirely unknown in the larval state, and many of those that are
  known having been very inadequately studied. We must admit that the classification of Diptera has
  at present advanced but little beyond the stage of arranging them in natural families capable of
  exact definition. We may, however, draw attention to the attempt that is being made by Osten
  Sacken to remodel the classification of the Nemocera and Brachycera by the combination of families
  into super-families.<a id="NtA_367" href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> He proposes to divide the
  Nemocera into two super-families: 1. Nemocera Vera, including all the families from Cecidomyiidae
  to Tipulidae; 2. Nemocera Anomala, consisting of the small families Bibionidae, Simuliidae,
  Blepharoceridae, Rhyphidae and Orphnephilidae.</p>

  <p>For Orthorrhapha Brachycera he adopts the following <span class="pagenum" id="page457"><span
  class="smaller">{457}</span></span>arrangement: 1. Super-family Eremochaeta, for Stratiomyidae,
  Tabanidae, Acanthomeridae and Leptidae; 2. Tromoptera, for Nemestrinidae, Acroceridae,
  Bombyliidae, Therevidae, and Scenopinidae; 3. Energopoda, for Asilidae, Dolichopidae, Empidae and
  Lonchopteridae, Phoridae being included with doubt; 4. Mydaidae remains isolated.</p>

  <p>This classification is based on the relations of the eyes and bristles of the upper surface,
  and on the powers of locomotion, a&euml;rial or terrestrial. At present it is not sufficiently precise
  to be of use to any but the very advanced student.</p>

  <p><b>Blood-sucking Diptera.</b>&mdash;The habit of blood-sucking from Vertebrates is, among
  Insects, of course confined to those with suctorial mouth, and is exhibited by various Diptera. It
  is, however, indulged in by but a small number of species, and these do not belong to any special
  division of the Order. It is remarkable that as a rule the habit is confined to the female sex,
  and that a large proportion of the species have aquatic larvae. This subject has many points of
  interest, but does not appear to have yet received the attention it merits. We give below a brief
  summary of the facts as to blood-sucking Diptera.</p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>Series I. Nemocera.&mdash;In this section the habit occurs in no less than five families,
    viz.:</p>
    <div class="bq2">
      <p>Blepharoceridae. <i>Curupira</i>; in the female only; larva aquatic.</p>
      <p>Culicidae. <i>Culex</i>, Mosquitoes; in the female only; other genera, with one or two
      exceptions, do not suck blood; larvae aquatic.</p>
      <p>Chironomidae. <i>Ceratopogon</i>, Midge; in the female only; exceptional even in the genus,
      though the habit is said to exist in one or two less known, allied genera; larval habits not
      certain; often aquatic; in <i>C. bipunctatus</i> the larva lives under moist bark.</p>
      <p>Psychodidae. <i>Phlebotomus</i>: in the female only (?); quite exceptional in the family;
      larva aquatic or in liquid filth.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Simuliidae. <i>Simulium</i>, sand-flies; general in the family (?), which,
      however, is a very small one; larva aquatic, food probably mixed vegetable and animal
      microscopic organisms.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Series II. Brachycera. Tabanidae. Gad-flies: apparently general in the females of this
    family; the habits of the exotic forms but little known; in the larval state, scarcely at all
    known; some are aquatic.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page458"><span class="smaller">{458}</span></span></div>
    <p>Series IV. Cyclorrhapha Schizophora: <i>Stomoxys</i>, <i>Haematobia</i>; both sexes (?);
    larvae in dung. [The Tse-tse flies, <i>Glossina</i>, are placed in this family, though their
    mode of parturition is that of the next section].</p>
    <p>Series V. Pupipara. The habit of blood-sucking is probably common to all the group and to
    both sexes. The flies, with one exception, frequent Vertebrates; in many cases living entirely
    on their bodies, and apparently imbibing much blood; the larvae are nourished inside the flies,
    not on the imbibed blood, but on a milky secretion from the mother.</p>
    <p class="sp0">Sub-Order Aphaniptera. Fleas. The habit of blood-sucking is common to all the
    members and to both sexes. The larvae live on dried animal matter.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fossil Diptera.</b>&mdash;A considerable variety of forms have been found in
  amber, and many in the tertiary beds; very few members of the Cyclorrhaphous Sections are,
  however, among them; the Tipulidae, on the other hand, are richly represented. In the Mesozoic
  epoch the Order is found as early as the Lias, the forms being exclusively Orthorrhaphous, both
  Nemocera and Brachycera being represented. All are referred to existing families. Nothing has been
  found tending to connect the Diptera with other Orders. No Palaeozoic Diptera are known.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series 1. Orthorrhapha Nemocera</b></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Cecidomyiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>An extensive family of very minute and fragile flies,
  the wings of which have very few nervures; the antennae are rather long, and are furnished with
  whorls of hair.</i> In the case of some species the antennae are beautiful objects; in
  <i>Xylodiplosis</i> some of the hairs have no free extremities, but form loops (Fig. 220). In the
  males of certain species the joints appear to be double, each one consisting of a neck and a body.
  Although comparatively little is known as to the flies themselves, yet these Insects are of
  importance on account of their preparatory stages. The larvae have very diverse habits; the
  majority live in plants and form galls, or produce deformations of the leaves, flowers, stems,
  buds, or roots in a great variety of ways; others live under bark or in animal matter; some are
  predaceous, killing Aphidae or Acari, and even other Cecidomyiids.</p>

  <p>The North American <i>Diplosis resinicola</i> lives in the resin exuded as the results of the
  attacks of a caterpillar. The larva burrows in the semi-liquid resin, and, according to Osten
  Sacken,<a id="NtA_368" href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> is probably amphipneustic. Cecidomyiid
  larvae are short maggots, narrowed at the two ends, with a very small head, and between this and
  the first thoracic segment (this bears a stigma), a small supplementary segment; the total number
  of segments is thirteen, besides the head; there are eight pairs of stigmata on the posterior part
  of the body. Brauer defines the Cecidomyiid larva thus, "peripneustic, with nine pairs of
  stigmata, the first on the second segment behind the head; two to nine on fifth to twelfth
  segments; body as a whole fourteen-segmented without a fully-formed head." The most remarkable
  peculiarity of Cecidomyiid larvae is that those of many species possess a peculiar
  organ&mdash;called breast-bone, sternal spatula, or anchor-process&mdash;projecting from the back
  of the lower face of the prothoracic segment. The use of so peculiar a structure has been much
  discussed. According to Giard,<a id="NtA_369" href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> in addition to
  the part <span class="pagenum" id="page460"><span class="smaller">{460}</span></span>that
  protrudes externally, as shown in Fig. 219, A, there is a longer portion concealed, forming a sort
  of handle, having muscles attached to it. Some of these larvae have the power of executing leaps,
  and he states that such larvae are provided on the terminal segment with a pair of corneous
  papillae; bending itself almost into a circle, the larva hooks together the breast-bone and the
  papillae, and when this connection is broken the spring occurs. This faculty is only possessed by
  a few species, and it is probable that in other cases the spatula is used as a means for changing
  the position or as a perforator. Some of the larvae possess false feet on certain of the segments.
  Williston says they probably do not moult. In the pupal instar (Fig. 219, B), the Cecidomyiid
  greatly resembles a minute Lepidopterous pupa. The Hessian fly, <i>Cecidomyia destructor</i>, is
  frequently extremely injurious to crops of cereals, and in some parts of the world commits serious
  depredation. The larva is lodged at the point where a leaf enwraps the stem; it produces a
  weakness of the stem, which consequently bends. This Insect and <i>C. tritici</i> (the larva of
  which attacks the flowers of wheat) pupate in a very curious manner: they form little compact
  cases like flax-seeds; these have been supposed to be a form of pupa similar to what occurs in the
  Blow-fly; but there are important distinctions. The larva, when about to undergo its change,
  exudes a substance from its skin, and this makes the flax-seed; the larval skin itself does not
  form part of this curious kind of cocoon, for it may be found, as well as the pupa, in the
  interior of the "flax-seed." Other Cecidomyiids form cocoons of a more ordinary kind; one species,
  described by Perris as living on <i>Pinus maritima</i>, has the very remarkable faculty of
  surrounding itself, by some means, with a cocoon of resin. Walsh describes the cocoon-forming
  process of certain Cecidomyiids as one of exudation and inflation; Williston as somewhat of the
  nature of crystallisation. Some Cecidomyiids are said to possess, in common with certain other
  Diptera, the unusual number of five Malpighian tubes; and Giard says that in the larva there is
  only a pair of these tubes, and that their extremities are united so as to form a single tube,
  which is twisted into an elegant double loop.</p>

  <p>Thirty years or more ago the Russian naturalist, Wagner, made the very remarkable discovery
  that the larva of a Cecidomyiid produces young; and it has since been found by Meinert and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page461"><span class="smaller">{461}</span></span>others that this kind of
  paedogenesis occurs in several species of the genera <i>Miastor</i> and <i>Oligarces</i>. The
  details are briefly as follows:&mdash;A female fly lays a few, very large, eggs, out of each of
  which comes a larva, that does not go on to the perfect state, but produces in its interior young
  larvae that, after consuming the interior of the body of the parent larva, escape by making a hole
  in the skin, and thereafter subsist externally in a natural manner. This larval reproduction may
  be continued for several generations, through autumn, winter, and spring till the following
  summer, when a generation of the larvae goes on to pupation and the mature, sexually perfect fly
  appears. Much discussion has taken place as to the mode of origination of the larvae; Carus and
  others thought they were produced from the rudimental, or immature ovaries of the parent larva.
  Meinert, who has made a special study of the subject,<a id="NtA_370"
  href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> finds, however, that this is not the case; in the reproducing
  larva of the autumn there is no ovary at all; in the reproducing larvae of the spring-time
  rudimentary ovaries or testes, as the case may be, exist; the young are not, however, produced
  from these, but from germs in close connection with the fat-body. In the larvae that go on to
  metamorphosis the ovaries continue their natural development. It would thus appear that the
  fat-body has, like the leaf of a <i>Begonia</i>, under certain circumstances, the power, usually
  limited to the ovaries, of producing complete and perfect individuals.</p>

  <p>Owing to the minute size and excessive fragility of the Gall-midge flies it is extremely
  difficult to form a collection of them; and as the larvae are also very difficult of preservation,
  nearly every species must have its life-history worked out as a special study before the name of
  the species can be ascertained. Notwithstanding the arduous nature of the subject it is, however,
  a favourite one with entomologists. The number of described and named forms cannot be very far
  short of 1000, and each year sees some 20 or 30 species added to the list. The number of
  undescribed forms is doubtless very large. The literature of the subject is extensive and of the
  most scattered and fragmentary character.</p>

  <p>The Cecidomyiidae have but little relation to other Nemocera, and are sometimes called
  Oligoneura, on account of the reduced number of wing-nervures. Their larvae are of a peculiar type
  <span class="pagenum" id="page462"><span class="smaller">{462}</span></span>that does not agree
  with the larvae of the allied families having well-marked heads (and therefore called Eucephala),
  nor with the acephalous maggots of Eumyiidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Mycetophilidae.</b>&mdash;<i>These small flies are much less delicate creatures than
  the Cecidomyiidae, and have more nervures in the wings; they possess ocelli, and frequently have
  the coxae elongated, and in some cases the legs adorned with complex arrangements of spines: their
  antennae have not whorls of hair.</i> Although very much neglected there are probably between 700
  and 1000 species known; owing to many of their larvae living in fungoid matter the flies are
  called Fungus-gnats. We have more than 100 species in Britain. <i>Epidapus</i> is remarkable,
  inasmuch as the female is entirely destitute of wings and halteres, while the male has the
  halteres developed but the wings of very reduced size. <i>E. scabiei</i> is an excessively minute
  fly, smaller than a common flea, and its larva is said to be very injurious to stored potatoes.
  The larvae of Mycetophilidae are usually very elongate, worm-like maggots, but have a distinct,
  small head; they are peripneustic, having, according to Osten Sacken, nine pairs of spiracles, one
  pair prothoracic, the others on the first eight abdominal segments. They are usually worm-like,
  and sometimes seem to consist of twenty segments. Some of them have the faculty of constructing a
  true cocoon by some sort of spinning process, and a few make earthen cases for the purpose of
  pupation. The pupae themselves are free, the larval skin having been shed. The Mycetophilidae are
  by no means completely fungivorous, for many live in decaying vegetable, some even in animal,
  matter.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The habits of many of the larvae are very peculiar, owing to their spinning or exuding a mucus,
  that reminds one of snail-slime; they are frequently gregarious, and some of them have likewise,
  as we shall subsequently mention, migratory habits. Perris has described the very curious manner
  in which <i>Sciophila <span class="pagenum" id="page463"><span
  class="smaller">{463}</span></span>unimaculata</i> forms its slimy tracks;<a id="NtA_371"
  href="#Nt_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a> it stretches its head to one side, fixes the tip of a drop of
  the viscous matter from its mouth to the surface of the substance over which it is to progress,
  bends its head under itself so as to affix the matter to the lower face of its own body; then
  stretches its head to the other side and repeats the operation, thus forming a track on which it
  glides, or perhaps, as the mucus completely envelops its body, we should rather call it a tunnel
  through which the maggot slips along. According to the description of Hudson<a id="NtA_372"
  href="#Nt_372"><sup>[372]</sup></a> the so-called New Zealand Glow-worm is the larva of
  <i>Boletophila luminosa</i>; it forms webs in dark ravines, along which it glides, giving a
  considerable amount of light from the peculiarly formed terminal segment of the body. This larva
  is figured as consisting of about twenty segments. The pupa is provided with a very long,
  curiously-branched dorsal structure: the fly issuing from the pupa is strongly luminous, though no
  use can be discovered for the property either in it or in the larva. The larva of the Australian
  <i>Ceroplatus mastersi</i> is also luminous. Another very exceptional larva is that of <i>Epicypta
  scatophora</i>; it is of short, thick form, like Cecidomyiid larvae, and has a very remarkable
  structure of the dorsal parts of the body; by means of this its excrement, which is of a peculiar
  nature, is spread out and forms a case for enveloping and sheltering the larva. Ultimately the
  larval case is converted into a cocoon for pupation. This larva is so different from that of other
  Mycetophilidae, that Perris was at first unable to believe that the fly he reared really came from
  this unusually formed larva. The larva of <i>Mycetobia pallipes</i> (Fig. 221) offers a still more
  remarkable phenomenon, inasmuch as it is amphipneustic instead of peripneustic (that is to say, it
  has a pair of stigmata at the termination of the body and a pair on the first thoracic segment
  instead of the lateral series of pairs we have described as normal in Mycetophilidae). This larva
  lives in company with the amphipneustic larva of <i>Rhyphus</i>, a fly of quite another family,
  and the <i>Mycetobia</i> larva so closely resembles that of the <i>Rhyphus</i>, that it is
  difficult to distinguish the two. This anomalous larva gives rise, like the exceptional larva of
  <i>Epicypta</i>, to an ordinary Mycetophilid fly.<a id="NtA_373"

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page464"><span class="smaller">{464}</span></span></div>

  <p>But the most remarkable of all the Mycetophilid larvae are those of certain species of
  <i>Sciara</i>, that migrate in columns, called by the Germans, Heerwurm. The larva of <i>Sciara
  militaris</i> lives under layers of decomposing leaves in forests, and under certain
  circumstances, migrates, sometimes perhaps in search of a fresh supply of food, though in some
  cases it is said this cannot be the reason. Millions of the larvae accumulate and form themselves
  by the aid of their viscous mucus into great strings or ribbons, and then glide along like
  serpents: these aggregates are said to be sometimes forty to a hundred feet long, five or six
  inches wide, and an inch in depth. It is said that if the two ends of one of these processions be
  brought into contact, they become joined, and the monstrous ring may writhe for many hours before
  it can again disengage itself and assume a columnar form. These processional maggots are met with
  in Northern Europe and the United States, and there is now an extensive literature about them.<a
  id="NtA_374" href="#Nt_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a> Though they sometimes consist of almost
  incredible numbers of individuals, yet it appears that in the Carpathian mountains the assemblages
  are usually much smaller, being from four to twenty inches long. A species of <i>Sciara</i> is the
  "Yellow-fever fly" of the Southern United States. It appears that it has several times appeared in
  unusual numbers and in unwonted localities at the same time as the dreaded disease, with which it
  is popularly supposed to have some connection.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Blepharoceridae.</b><a id="NtA_375" href="#Nt_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Wings
  with no discal cell, but with a secondary set of crease-like lines.</i> The flies composing this
  small family are very little known, and appear to be obscure Insects with somewhat the appearance
  of Empidae, though with strongly iridescent wings; they execute aerial dances, after the manner of
  midges, and are found in Europe (the Pyrenees, Alps and Harz mountains) as well as in North and
  South America. Their larvae are amongst the most remarkable of Insect forms; indeed, no
  entomologist recognises them as belonging to a Hexapod Insect when he makes a first <span
  class="pagenum" id="page465"><span class="smaller">{465}</span></span>acquaintance with them. The
  larva of <i>Curupira</i> (Fig. 222) lives in rapid streams in Brazil, fixed by its suckers to
  stones or rocks. It consists only of six or seven divisions, with projecting side-lobes; the usual
  segmentation not being visible. There are small tracheal gills near the suckers, and peculiar
  scale-like organs are placed about the edges of the lobes. M&uuml;ller considers that the first lobe is
  "cephalothorax," corresponding to head, thorax and first abdominal segment of other larvae, the
  next four lobes he considers to correspond each to an abdominal segment, and the terminal mass to
  four segments. He also says that certain minute points existing on the surface, connected with the
  tracheal system by minute strings, represent nine pairs of spiracles. These larvae and their pupae
  can apparently live only a short time after being taken out of the highly a&euml;rated water in which
  they exist, but M&uuml;ller succeeded in rearing several flies from a number of larvae and pupae that
  he collected, and, believing them to be all one species, he announced that the females exhibited a
  highly developed dimorphism, some of them being blood-suckers, others honey-suckers. It is
  however, more probable that these specimens belonged to two or three distinct species or even
  genera. This point remains to be cleared up. The larva we have figured is called by M&uuml;ller
  <i>Paltostoma torrentium</i>. It is certain, however, that the Brazilian Insect does not belong to
  the genus <i>Paltostoma</i>, and it will no doubt bear the name used by Osten Sacken, viz.
  <i>Curupira</i>.</p>

  <p>The metamorphoses of the European <i>Liponeura brevirostris</i> have been partially examined by
  Dewitz, who found the Insects in the valley of the Ocker in September.<a id="NtA_376"
  href="#Nt_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a> He does not consider the "cephalothorax" to include an
  abdominal segment; and he found that two little, horn-like projections from the thorax of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page466"><span class="smaller">{466}</span></span>pupa are really each
  four-leaved. The pupa is formed within the larval skin, but the latter is subsequently cast so
  that the pupa is exposed; its dorsal region is horny, but the under surface, by which it clings
  firmly to the stones of the rapid brook, is white and scarcely chitinised, and Dewitz considers
  that the chitinous exudation from this part is used as a means of fastening the pupa to the
  stones. Blepharoceridae possess, in common with <i>Culex</i>, <i>Psychoda</i> and
  <i>Ptychoptera</i>, the peculiar number of five Malpighian tubes, and it has been proposed by
  M&uuml;ller to form these Insects into a group called Pentanephria.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Culicidae</b> (<i>Mosquitoes</i>, <i>Gnats</i>).&mdash;<i>Antennae with whorls of
  hair or plumes, which may be very dense and long in the male, though scanty in the female; head
  with a long, projecting proboscis.</i> Although there are few Insects more often referred to in
  general literature than Mosquitoes, yet the ideas in vogue about them are of the vaguest
  character. The following are the chief points to be borne in mind as to the prevalence of
  Mosquitoes:&mdash;The gently humming Gnat that settles on us in our apartments, and then bites us,
  is a Mosquito; there are a large number of species of Mosquitoes; in some countries many in one
  locality; in Britain we have ten or a dozen; notwithstanding the multiplicity of species, certain
  Mosquitoes are very widely diffused; the larvae are all aquatic, and specially frequent stagnant
  or quiet pools; they are probably diffused by means of the water in ships, it being known that
  Mosquitoes were introduced for the first time to the Hawaiian Islands by a sailing vessel about
  the year 1828. Hence it is impossible to say what species the Mosquitoes of a given locality may
  be without a critical examination. No satisfactory work on the Mosquitoes of the world exists.
  Urich states that he is acquainted with at least ten species in Trinidad. The species common in
  our apartments in Central and Southern England is <i>Culex pipiens</i>, Linn., and this species is
  very widely distributed, being indeed one of the troublesome Mosquitoes of East India. The term
  Mosquito is a Spanish or Portuguese diminutive of Mosca. It is applied to a variety of small flies
  of other families than Culicidae, but should be restricted to these latter. The irritation
  occasioned by the bites of Mosquitoes varies according to several circumstances, viz. the
  condition of the biter, the condition or constitution of the bitten, and also the species of
  Mosquito. R&eacute;aumur and <span class="pagenum" id="page467"><span
  class="smaller">{467}</span></span>others believed that some irritating fluid is injected by the
  Mosquito when it bites. But why should it want to irritate as well as to bite? Macloskie,
  considering that the Mosquito is really a feeder on plant-substances, suggests that the fluid
  injected may be for the purpose of preventing coagulation of the plant-juices during the process
  of suction. It is a rule that only the female Mosquito bites, the male being an inoffensive
  creature, and provided with less effectual mouth-organs; it has, however, been stated by various
  authors that male Mosquitoes do occasionally bite. It is difficult to understand the blood-sucking
  propensities of these Insects; we have already stated that it is only the females that suck blood.
  There is reason to suppose that it is an acquired habit; and it would appear that the food so
  obtained is not essential to their existence. It has indeed been asserted that the act is
  frequently attended with fatal consequences to the individual that does it. The proper method of
  mitigating their nuisance is to examine the stagnant waters in localities where they occur, and
  deal with them so as to destroy the larvae. These little creatures are remarkable from the heads
  and thorax being larger and more distinct than in other Dipterous larvae. Their metamorphoses have
  been frequently described, and recently the numerous interesting points connected with their
  life-histories have been admirably portrayed by Professor Miall,<a id="NtA_377"
  href="#Nt_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> in an accessible form, so that it is unnecessary for us to
  deal with them. <i>Corethra</i> is placed in Culicidae, but the larva differs totally from that of
  <i>Culex</i>; it is predaceous in habits, is very transparent, has only an imperfect tracheal
  system, without spiracles, and has two pairs of air-sacs (perhaps we should rather say pigmented
  structures possibly for aerostatic purposes, but not suppliers of oxygen). The kungu cake
  mentioned by Livingstone as used on Lake Nyassa is made from an Insect which occurs in profusion
  there, and is compressed into biscuit form. It is believed to be a <i>Corethra</i>. One of the
  peculiarities of this family is the prevalence of scales on various parts of the body, and even on
  the wings: the scales are essentially similar to those of Lepidoptera. Though Mosquitoes are
  generally obscure plain Insects, there are some&mdash;in the South American genus
  <i>Megarrhina</i>&mdash;that are elegant, beautifully adorned creatures. Swarms of various species
  of Culicidae, consisting sometimes of almost incalculable numbers <span class="pagenum"
  id="page468"><span class="smaller">{468}</span></span>of individuals, occur in various parts of
  the world; one in New Zealand is recorded as having been three-quarters of a mile long, twenty
  feet high, and eighteen inches thick. There is good reason for supposing that Mosquitoes may act
  as disseminators of disease, but there is no certain evidence on the subject. The minute
  <i>Filaria</i> that occurs in great numbers in some patients, is found in the human body only in
  the embryonic and adult conditions. Manson considers that the intermediate stages are passed in
  the bodies of certain Mosquitoes.<a id="NtA_378" href="#Nt_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Chironomidae</b> (<i>Gnats</i>, <i>Midges</i>).&mdash;<i>Small or minute flies of
  slender form, with narrow wings, without projecting rostrum, usually with densely feathered
  antennae in the male, and long slender legs.</i> The flies of this family bear a great general
  resemblance to the Culicidae. They are much more numerous in species, and it is not improbable
  that we have in this country 200 species of the genus <i>Chironomus</i> alone. They occur in
  enormous numbers, and frequently form dancing swarms in the neighbourhood of the waters they live
  in. The species are frequently extremely similar to one another, though distinguished by good
  characters; they are numerous about Cambridge. Many of them have the habit of using the front legs
  as feelers rather than as means of support or locomotion. This is the opposite of what occurs in
  Culicidae, where many of the species have a habit of holding up the hind legs as if they were
  feelers. The eggs of <i>Chironomus</i> are deposited as strings surrounded by mucus, and are many
  of them so transparent that the development of the embryo can be directly observed with the aid of
  the microscope. They are said to possess a pair of air-sacs. The larvae, when born, are aquatic in
  habits, and are destitute of tracheal system. They subsequently differ greatly from the larvae of
  <i>Culex</i>, inasmuch as the tracheal system that develops is quite closed, and in some cases
  remains rudimentary. There is, however, much diversity in the larvae and also in the pupae. The
  little Blood-worms, very common in many stagnant and dirty waters, and used by anglers as bait,
  are larvae of <i>Chironomus</i>. They are said to be <span title="hai&nbsp;Empides"
  class="fsn">&alpha;&#x1F31; &#x1F18;&mu;&pi;&#x03AF;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span> of Aristotle.
  The red colour of these larvae is due to haemoglobin, a substance which has the power of
  attracting and storing oxygen, and giving it off to the tissues as they require it. Such larvae
  are able to live in burrows they construct <span class="pagenum" id="page469"><span
  class="smaller">{469}</span></span>amongst the mud. Some of them, provided plentifully with
  haemoglobin, are in consequence able to live at great depths, it is said even at 1000 feet in Lake
  Superior, and come to the surface only occasionally. A few are able even to tolerate salt water,
  and have been fished up from considerable depths in the sea. It is a remarkable fact that these
  physiological capacities differ greatly within the limits of the one genus, <i>Chironomus</i>, for
  some of these species are destitute of haemoglobin, and have to live near the surface of the
  water; these have a superior development of the tracheal system. The pupae of <i>Chironomus</i>
  have the legs coiled, and the thorax, instead of being provided with the pair of tubes or trumpets
  for breathing that is so common in this division of Diptera, have a pair of large tufts of
  hair-like filaments.<a id="NtA_379" href="#Nt_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> A very curious form of
  parthenogenesis has been described by Grimm<a id="NtA_380" href="#Nt_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a> as
  existing in an undetermined species of <i>Chironomus</i>, inasmuch as the pupa deposits eggs.
  Although this form of parthenogenesis is of much interest, it is not in any way to be compared
  with the case, already referred to, of <i>Miastor</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page461">461</a></span>). The "pupa" is at the time of oviposition practically the imago
  still covered by the pupal integument; indeed Grimm informs us that in some cases, after
  depositing a small number of ova, the pupa became an imago. This parthenogenesis only occurs in
  the spring-generation; in the autumn the development goes on in the natural manner. The case is
  scarcely entitled to be considered as one of paedogenesis.</p>

  <p>Gnats of this family, and believed to be a variety of <i>Chironomus plumosus</i>, are subject
  to a curious condition, inasmuch as individuals sometimes become luminous or "phosphorescent";
  this has been noticed more specially in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. The whole of the body and
  legs may exhibit the luminous condition, but not the wings. It has been suggested by Schmidt that
  this condition is a disease due to bacteria in the body of the gnat.<a id="NtA_381"
  href="#Nt_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Ceratopogon</i> is a very extensive genus, and is to some extent anomalous as a member of
  Chironomidae. The larvae exhibit considerable variety of form. Some of them are aquatic <span
  class="pagenum" id="page470"><span class="smaller">{470}</span></span>in habits, but the great
  majority are terrestrial, frequenting trees, etc. The former larvae are very slender, and move
  after the manner of leeches; they give rise to imagos with naked wings, while the terrestrial
  larvae produce flies with hairy wings. There are also important distinctions in the pupae of the
  two kinds; the correlation between the habits, and the distinctions above referred to, is,
  however, far from being absolutely constant.<a id="NtA_382" href="#Nt_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a>
  Certain species of midges are in this country amongst the most annoying of Insects; being of very
  minute size, scarcely visible, they settle on the exposed parts of the body in great numbers, and
  by sucking blood create an intolerable irritation. <i>Ceratopogon varius</i> is one of the most
  persistent of these annoyers in Scotland, where this form of pest is much worse than it is in
  England; in Cambridgeshire, according to Mr. G. H. Verrall, the two troublesome midges are the
  females of <i>C. pulicaris</i> and <i>C. bipunctatus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Orphnephilidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Small, brown or yellowish flies, bare of pubescence,
  with very large eyes contiguous in both sexes, and with antennae composed of two joints and a
  terminal bristle; both the second joint and the bristle are, however, really complex.</i> One of
  the smallest and least known of the families of Diptera, and said to be one of the most difficult
  to classify. The nervures of the wings are very distinct. Nothing is known of the habits and
  metamorphoses; there is only one genus&mdash;<i>Orphnephila</i>; it is widely distributed; we have
  one species in Britain.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Psychodidae</b> (<i>Moth-flies</i>).&mdash;<i>Extremely small, helpless flies,
  usually with thickish antennae, bearing much hair, with wings broader than is usual in small
  flies, and also densely clothed with hair, giving rise to a pattern more or less vague.</i> These
  flies are very fragile creatures, and are probably numerous in species. In Britain forty or fifty
  species have been recognised.<a id="NtA_383" href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> A South European
  form is a blood-sucker, and has received the appropriate name of <i>Phlebotomus</i>. The
  life-history of <i>Pericoma canescens</i> has recently been studied by Professor Miall.<a
  id="NtA_384" href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a> The larva is of aquatic habits, but is
  amphibious, being capable of existing in the air; it has a pair of anterior spiracles, by means
  <span class="pagenum" id="page471"><span class="smaller">{471}</span></span>of which it breathes
  in the air, and a pair at the posterior extremity of the body, surrounded by four ciliated
  processes, with which it forms a sort of cup for holding air when it is in the water. The
  favourite position is amongst the filaments of green algae on which it feeds. A much more
  extraordinary form of larva from South America, doubtless belonging to this family, has recently
  been portrayed by Fritz M&uuml;ller, under the name of <i>Maruina</i>.<a id="NtA_385"
  href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a> These larvae live in rapid waters in company with those of the
  genus <i>Curupira</i>, and like the latter are provided with a series of suctorial ventral discs.
  Fritz M&uuml;ller's larvae belong to several species, and probably to more than one genus, and the
  respiratory apparatus at the extremity of the body exhibits considerable diversity among them.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Dixidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Dixa</i> must, it appears, form a distinct family
  allying the Culicid series of families to the Tipulidae. The species are small, gnat-like Insects,
  fond of damp places in forests. We have four British species (<i>D. maculata</i>, <i>D.
  nebulosa</i>, <i>D. aestivalis</i>, <i>D. aprilina</i>). The genus is very widely distributed,
  occurring even in Australia. The larvae are aquatic, and have been described by R&eacute;aumur, Miall,
  and Meinert. The pupa has the legs coiled as in the Culicidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Tipulidae</b> (<i>Daddy-long-legs, or Crane-flies</i>).&mdash;<i>Slender Insects
  with elongate legs, a system of wing-nervures, rather complex, especially at the tip; an angulate,
  or open V-shaped, suture on the dorsum of the thorax in front of the wings: the female with the
  body terminated by a pair of hard, pointed processes, concealing some other processes, and forming
  an ovipositor.</i> The curious, silly Insects called daddy-long-legs are known all over the world,
  the family being a very large one, and found everywhere, some of its members extending their range
  even to the most inclement climates. It includes a great variety of forms that would not be
  recognised by the uninitiated, but can be readily distinguished by the characters mentioned above.
  It is impossible to assign any reason of utility for the extreme elongation of the legs of these
  Insects; as everyone knows, they break off with great ease, and the Insect appears to get on
  perfectly well without them. It is frequently <span class="pagenum" id="page472"><span
  class="smaller">{472}</span></span>the case that they are much longer in the males than in the
  females. Other parts of the body exhibit a peculiar elongation; in some forms of the male the
  front of the head may be prolonged into a rostrum. In a few species the head is separated by a
  great distance from the thorax, the gap being filled by elongate, hard, cervical sclerites; indeed
  it is in these Insects that the phenomenon, so rare in Insect-structure, of the elongation of
  these sclerites and their becoming a part of the actual external skeleton, reaches its maximum. In
  several species of <i>Eriocera</i> the male has the antennae of extraordinary length, four or five
  times as long as the body, and, strange to say, this elongation is accompanied by a reduction in
  the number of the segments of which the organ is composed, the number being in the male about six,
  in the female ten, in place of the usual fourteen or sixteen. In <i>Toxorrhina</i> and
  <i>Elephantomyia</i> the proboscis is as long as the whole body. In other forms the wings become
  elongated to an unusual extent by means of a basal stalk. It is probable that the elongation of
  the rostrum may be useful to the Insects. Gosse,<a id="NtA_386"
  href="#Nt_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> indeed, describes <i>Limnobia intermedia</i> as having a
  rostrum half as long as the body, and as hovering like a Syrphid, but this is a habit so foreign
  to Tipulidae, that we may be pardoned for suspecting a mistake. The larvae exhibit a great variety
  of form, some being terrestrial and others aquatic, but the terrestrial forms seem all to delight
  in damp situations, such as shaded turf or rotten tree-stems. They are either amphipneustic or
  metapneustic, that is, with a pair of spiracles placed at the posterior extremity of the body; the
  aquatic species frequently bear appendages or projections near these spiracles. The pupae in
  general structure are very like those of Lepidoptera, and have the legs extended straight along
  the body; they possess a pair of respiratory processes on the thorax in the form of horns or
  tubes.</p>

  <p>There are more than 1000 species of these flies known, and many genera. They form three
  sub-families, which are by some considered distinct families, viz.: Ptychopterinae, Limnobiinae or
  Tipulidae Brevipalpi, Tipulinae or Tipulidae Longipalpi.</p>

  <p>The Ptychopterinae are a small group in which the angulate <span class="pagenum"
  id="page473"><span class="smaller">{473}</span></span>suture of the mesonotum is indistinct; the
  larvae are aquatic and have the head free, the terminal two segments of the body enormously
  prolonged (Fig. 223), forming a long tail bearing, in the North American <i>Bittacomorpha</i>, two
  respiratory filaments. Hart<a id="NtA_387" href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> describes this tail
  as possessing a stigmatal opening at the extremity; no doubt the structure is a compounded pair of
  spiracles. The pupa (Fig. 223, B) has quite lost the respiratory tube at the posterior extremity
  of the body, but has instead quite as long a one at the anterior extremity, due to one tube of the
  pair normal in Tipulidae being enormously developed, while its fellow remains small. This is a
  most curious departure from the bilateral symmetry that is so constantly exhibited in
  Insect-structure. Our British species of <i>Ptychoptera</i> have the pupal respiratory tube as
  extraordinary as it is in <i>Bittacomorpha</i>, though the larval tail is less peculiar.<a
  id="NtA_388" href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> This group should perhaps be distinguished from
  the Tipulidae as a separate family, but taxonomists are not yet unanimous as to this. Brauer
  considers that the head of the larva, and the condition of five Malpighian tubules in the imago,
  require the association of Ptychopterinae with the preceding families (Chironomidae, etc.), rather
  than with the Tipulidae.</p>

  <p>The great majority of the Tipulidae are comprised in the sub-family Limnobiinae&mdash;the
  Tipulidae Brevipalpi of Osten Sacken:<a id="NtA_389" href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> in them
  the last joint of the palpi is shorter or not much longer than the two preceding together. They
  exhibit great variety, and many of them are types of fragility. The common winter gnats of the
  genus <i>Trichocera</i> are a fair sample of this sub-family. The species of this genus mostly
  inhabit high latitudes, and delight in <span class="pagenum" id="page474"><span
  class="smaller">{474}</span></span>a low temperature; it has been said that they may be seen on
  the wing in the depth of winter when the temperature is below freezing, but it is pretty certain
  that the spots chosen by the Insects are above that temperature, and Eaton states that the usual
  temperature during their evolutions is about 40&deg; or 45&deg; Fahr. They often appear in the damp
  conditions of a thaw when much snow is on the ground. <i>T. simonyi</i> was found at an elevation
  of 9000 feet in the Tyrol, crawling at a temperature below the freezing-point, when the ground was
  deeply covered with snow. <i>T. regelationis</i> occurs commonly in mines even when they are 500
  feet or more deep. The most extraordinary of the Limnobiinae is the genus <i>Chionea</i>, the
  species of which are totally destitute of wings and require a low temperature. <i>C.
  araneoides</i> inhabits parts of northern Europe, but descends as far south as the mountains near
  Vienna; it is usually said to be only really active in the depth of winter and on the surface of
  the snow. More recently, however, a large number of specimens were found by Professor Thomas in
  the month of October in his garden in Thuringia; they were caught in little pit-falls constructed
  to entrap snails. The larva of this Insect is one of the interesting forms that display the
  transition from a condition with spiracles at the sides of the body to one where there is only a
  pair at the posterior extremity.</p>

  <p>A very peculiar Fly, in which the wings are reduced to mere slips, <i>Halirytus amphibius</i>,
  was discovered by Eaton in Kerguelen Land, where it is habitually covered by the rising tide.
  Though placed in Tipulidae, it is probably a Chironomid.</p>

  <p>The group Cylindrotomina is considered by Osten Sacken<a id="NtA_390"
  href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> to be to some extent a primitive one having relationship with
  the Tipulinae; it was, he says, represented by numerous species in North America during the
  Oligocene period. It is of great interest on account of the larvae, which are in several respects
  similar to caterpillars of Lepidoptera. The larva of <i>Cylindrotoma distincta</i> lives upon the
  leaves of plants&mdash;<i>Anemone</i>, <i>Viola</i>, <i>Stellaria</i>&mdash;almost like a
  caterpillar; it is green with a crest along the back consisting of a row of fleshy processes.
  Though this fly is found in Britain the larva has apparently not been observed here. The
  life-history of <i>Phalacrocera replicata</i> has been recently published by Miall and Shelford.<a
  id="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> The larva eats <span class="pagenum"
  id="page475"><span class="smaller">{475}</span></span>submerged mosses in the South of England,
  and bears long forked filaments, reminding one of those of caterpillars. This species has been
  simultaneously discussed by Bengtsson, who apparently regards these Tipulids with caterpillar-like
  larvae&mdash;he calls them Erucaeformia<a id="NtA_392"
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a>&mdash;as the most primitive form of existing Diptera.</p>

  <p>The Tipulinae&mdash;Tipulidae Longipalpi, Osten Sacken<a id="NtA_393"
  href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a>&mdash;have the terminal joint of the palpi remarkably long,
  longer than the three preceding joints together. The group includes the largest forms, and the
  true daddy-long-legs, a Chinese species of which, <i>Tipula brobdignagia</i>, measures four inches
  across the expanded wings. The group contains some of the finest Diptera. Some of the exotic forms
  allied to <i>Ctenophora</i> have the wings coloured in the same manner as they are in certain
  Hymenoptera, and bear a considerable resemblance to members of that Order.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Bibionidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Flies of moderate or small size, sometimes of different
  colours in the two sexes, with short, thick, straight, antennae; front tibiae usually with a long
  pointed process; coxae not elongate. Eyes of male large, united, or contiguous in front.</i> The

  abundant; they are of sluggish habits and poor performers on the wing.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The difference in colour of the sexes is very remarkable, red or yellow predominating in the
  female, intense black in the male; and it is a curious fact that the same sexual distinction of
  colour reappears in various parts of the world&mdash;England, America, India, and New Zealand;
  moreover, this occurs in genera that are by no means closely allied, although allied species
  frequently have concolorous sexes. The eyes of the males are well worth study, there being a very
  large upper portion, and, abruptly separated from this, a smaller, differently faceted lower
  portion, practically a separate eye; though so largely developed the upper eye is in some cases so
  hairy that it must greatly interfere with the formation of a continuous picture. Carri&egrave;re
  considers that the small lower eye of the male corresponds to the whole eye of the female. The
  larvae of <i>Bibio</i> (Fig. 225) are caterpillar-like in form, have a horny head, well developed,
  biting mouth-organs, and spine-like processes on the body-segments. They are certified by good
  authorities<a id="NtA_394" href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> to possess the extremely unusual
  number of ten pairs of spiracles; a larva found at Cambridge, which we refer to <i>Bibio</i> (Fig.
  225) has nine pairs of moderate spiracles, as well as a large terminal pair separated from the
  others by a segment without spiracles. The genus <i>Dilophus</i> is closely allied to
  <i>Bibio</i>, the larvae of which (and those of Bibionidae in general) are believed to feed on
  vegetable substances; the parasitism of <i>Dilophus vulgaris</i> on the larva of a moth,
  <i>Epinotia</i> (<i>Chaetoptria</i>) <i>hypericana</i>, as recorded by Meade,<a id="NtA_395"
  href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a> must therefore be an exceptional case. In the genus
  <i>Scatopse</i> there is a very important point to be cleared up as to the larval respiratory
  system; it is said by Dufour and Perris<a id="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> to be
  amphipneustic; there are, however, nine projections on each side of the body that were considered
  by Bouch&eacute;, and probably with good reason, to <span class="pagenum" id="page477"><span
  class="smaller">{477}</span></span>be spiracles. The food of <i>Scatopse</i> in the larval state
  is principally vegetable. The larva of <i>Scatopse</i> changes to a pupa inside the larval skin;
  the pupa is provided on the thorax with two branched respiratory processes that project outside
  the larval skin.<a id="NtA_397" href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a> Lucas has given an interesting
  account of the occurrence of the larva of <i>Bibio marci</i> in enormous numbers at Paris; they

  <p>Owing to the great numbers in which the species of Bibionidae sometimes appear, these Insects
  have been supposed to be very injurious. Careful inquiry has, however, generally exculpated them
  as doers of any serious injury, though <i>Dilophus febrilis</i>&mdash;a so-called
  fever-fly&mdash;appears to be really injurious in this country when it multiplies excessively, by
  eating the roots of the hop-plant.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Simuliidae</b> (<i>Sand-flies</i>, <i>Buffalo-gnats</i>).&mdash;<i>Small obese
  flies with humped back, rather short legs and broad wings, with short, straight antennae destitute
  of setae; proboscis not projecting.</i> There is only one genus, <i>Simulium</i>, of this family,
  but it is very widely spread, and will probably prove to be nearly cosmopolitan. Some of the
  species are notorious from their blood-sucking habits, and in certain seasons multiply to an
  enormous extent, alight in thousands on cattle, and induce a disease that produces death in a few
  hours; it is thought as the result of an instilled poison. <i>S. columbaczense</i> has occasioned
  great losses amongst the herds near the Danube; in North America the Buffalo- and Turkey-gnats
  attack a variety of mammals and birds. In Britain <span class="pagenum" id="page478"><span
  class="smaller">{478}</span></span>and other parts of the world they do not increase in numbers to
  an extent sufficient to render them seriously injurious: their bite is however very annoying and
  irritating to ourselves. In their early stages they are aquatic and require well a&euml;rated waters:
  the larvae hold themselves erect, fixed to a stone or some other object by the posterior
  extremity, and have on the head some beautiful fringes which are agitated in order to bring food
  within reach; the pupae are still more remarkable, each one being placed in a pouch or sort of
  watch-pocket, from which projects the upper part of the body provided with a pair of filamentous
  respiratory processes. For an account of the interesting circumstances connected with the
  metamorphoses of this species the reader should refer to Professor Miall's book; and for the
  life-history of the American Buffalo-gnat to Riley.<a id="NtA_399"
  href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 12. Rhyphidae.</b>&mdash;This is another of the families that have only two
  or three genera, and yet are very widely distributed. These little flies are distinguished from
  other Nemocera Anomala (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page456">456</a></span>) by <i>the
  presence of a discal cell; the empodia of the feet are developed as if they were pulvilli, while
  the true pulvilli remain rudimentary</i>. The larvae are like little worms, being long and
  cylindric; they are amphipneustic, and have been found in decaying wood, in cow-dung, in rotten
  fruits, and even in dirty water. The "petite tipule," the metamorphoses of which were described
  and figured by R&eacute;aumur, is believed to be the common <i>Rhyphus fenestralis</i>.<a id="NtA_400"
  href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> <i>R. fenestralis</i> is often found on windows, as its name
  implies.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series 2. Orthorrhapha Brachycera</b></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. Stratiomyidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Antennae with three segments and a terminal complex of
  obscure joints, frequently bearing an arista: tibiae not spined; wings rather small, the anterior
  nervures usually much more strongly marked than those behind. The median cell small, placed near
  to the middle of the wing. Scutellum frequently spined; terminal appendages of the tarsi small,
  but pulvilli and a pulvilliform empodium are <span class="pagenum" id="page479"><span
  class="smaller">{479}</span></span>present.</i> This is a large family, whose members are very
  diversified, consequently definition of the whole is difficult. The species of the typical
  sub-family Stratiomyinae generally have the margins of the body prettily marked with green or
  yellow, and the scutellum spined. In the remarkable American genus, <i>Hermetia</i>, the abdomen
  is much constricted at the base, and the scutellum is not spined; in the division Sarginae the
  body is frequently of brilliant metallic colours. The species all have an only imperfect
  proboscis, and are not blood-suckers. The larvae are also of diverse habits; many of those of the
  Stratiomyinae are aquatic, and are noted for their capacity of living in salt, alkaline, or even
  very hot water. Mr. J. C. Hamon found some of these larvae in a hot spring in Wyoming, where he
  could not keep his hand immersed, and he estimated the temperature at only 20&deg; or 30&deg; Fahr. below
  the boiling-point. The larva of <i>Stratiomys</i> is of remarkably elongate, strap-like, form,
  much narrowed behind, with very small head; the terminal segment is very long and ends in a
  rosette of hairs which the creature allows to float at the surface. After the larval skin is shed
  the pupa, though free, is contained therein; the skin alters but little in form, and has no
  organic connection with the pupa, which merely uses the skin as a shield or float. These larvae
  have been very frequently described; they can live out of the water. Brauer describes the larvae
  of the family as "peripneustic, some perhaps amphipneustic." Miall says there are, in
  <i>Stratiomys</i>, nine pairs of spiracles on the sides of the body which are not open, though
  branches from the longitudinal air-tubes pass to them. There are probably upwards of 1000 species
  of Stratiomyidae known, and in Britain we have 40 or 50 kinds. The American genus
  <i>Chiromyza</i>, Wied., was formerly treated by Osten Sacken as a separate family, Chiromyzidae,
  but Williston places it in Stratiomyidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Leptidae</b>, including <b>Xylophagidae</b> and <b>Coenomyiidae</b>.&mdash;<i>The
  Leptidae proper are flies of feeble build; antennae with three joints and a terminal bristle; in
  the Xylophagidae the antennae are longer, and the third joint is complex. The wings have five
  posterior cells, the middle tibiae are spined. Pulvilli and a pulvilliform empodium present.</i>
  The three families are considered distinct by most authors, but there has always been much
  difficulty about the Xylophagidae and Coenomyiidae, we therefore treat them as sub-families.</p>

  <p>The Xylophaginae are a small group of slender Insects, perhaps most like the short-bodied kinds
  of Asilidae; the third joint of the antenna is vaguely segmented, and there is no terminal
  bristle. <i>Rhachicerus</i> is a most anomalous little fly with rather long stiff antennae of an
  almost nemocerous character, the segments of which give off a short thick prolongation on each
  side, reminding one of a two-edged saw. The three or four British species of Xylophaginae are
  forest Insects, the larvae of which live under bark, and are provided with a spear-like head with
  which they pierce other Insects. The Coenomyiinae consist of the one genus <i>Coenomyia</i>, with
  two or three European and North American species. They are remarkably thick-bodied, heavy flies,
  reminding one somewhat of an imperfect Stratiomyid destitute of ornamentation. The metamorphosis
  of <i>C. ferruginea</i> has been described by Beling.<a id="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> The larva is not aquatic, but lives in burrows or excavations
  in the earth where there are, or have recently been, rotten logs; it is probably predaceous. It is
  cylindric, with an extremely small head and eleven other segments, the stigma on the first
  thoracic segment distinct; the terminal segment is rather broad, and the structures surrounding
  the stigma are complex. The pupa has stigmata on each of abdominal segments 2 to 8.
  Notwithstanding that the fly is so different to <i>Xylophagus</i>, the larvae indicate the two
  forms as perhaps really allied. One of the Leptinae, <i>Atherix ibis</i>, has a singular mode of
  oviposition (Fig. 227), the females of the species deposit their eggs in common, and, dying as
  they do so, add their bodies to the common mass, which becomes an agglomeration, it may be of
  thousands of individuals, and of considerable size. The mass is attached to a branch of a bush or
  to a plant overhanging water, into which it <span class="pagenum" id="page481"><span
  class="smaller">{481}</span></span>ultimately falls. These curious accumulations are occasionally
  found in England as well as on the Continent, but no reason for so peculiar a habit is at present
  forthcoming. Still more remarkable are the habits of some European Leptids of the genera
  <i>Vermileo</i> (<i>Psammorycter</i> of some authors) and <i>Lampromyia</i>, slender rather small
  flies of Asilid-like appearance, the larvae of which form pit-falls after the manner of the
  Ant-lion. According to Beling<a id="NtA_402" href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> the larva of
  <i>Leptis</i> is very active, and is distinguished by having the stigmatic orifice surrounded by
  four quite equal, quadrangularly placed prominences; and at the other extremity of the body a
  blackish, naked, triangular plate; on the under side of each of seven of the abdominal segments
  there is a band of spines. The larva of <i>Atherix</i> has seven pairs of abdominal feet.
  Altogether there are some two or three hundred known species of Leptidae; our British species
  scarcely reach a score. They are destitute of biting-powers and are harmless timid creatures.
  <i>Leptis scolopacea</i>, the most conspicuous of our native species, a soft-bodied fly of rather
  large size, the wings much marked with dark colour, and the thick, pointed body yellowish, marked
  with a row of large black spots down the middle, is a common Insect in meadows.</p>

  <p>This large and important family of flies, of which Williston states that 1400 or 1500 species
  are named, is well known to travellers on account of the blood-sucking habits of its members; they
  have great powers of flight, and alight on man and animals, and draw blood by making an incision
  with the proboscis; only the females do this, the males wanting a pair of the lancets that enable
  the other sex to inflict their formidable wounds. They are comparatively large Insects, some of
  our English species of <i>Tabanus</i> attaining an inch in length. The smaller, grey
  <i>Haematopota</i>, is known to every one who has walked in woods or meadows in the summer, as it
  alights quietly on the hands or neck and bites one without his having previously been made aware
  of its presence. The larger Tabani hum so much that one always knows when an individual is near.
  The species of <i>Chrysops</i>, in habits similar to <i>Haematopota</i>, are remarkable for their
  beautifully coloured golden-green eyes. In Brazil the Motuca fly, <i>Hadrus lepidotus</i>, Perty,
  makes so large and deep a cut that considerable bleeding may follow, and as it sometimes settles
  in numbers on the body, it is deservedly feared. The most remarkable forms of Tabanidae are the
  species of the widely distributed genus <i>Pangonia</i> (Fig. 229). The proboscis in the females
  of some of the species is three or four times the length of the body, and as it is stiff and
  needle-like the creature can use it while hovering on the wing, and will pierce the human body
  even through clothing of considerable thickness. The males suck the juices of flowers. The Seroot
  fly, that renders some of the districts of Nubia uninhabitable for about three months of the year,
  appears, from the figure and description given by Sir Samuel Baker, to be a <i>Pangonia</i>.
  Tabanidae are a favourite food of the fossorial wasps of the family Bembecidae. These wasps are
  apparently aware of the blood-sucking habits of their favourites, and attend on travellers and
  pick up the flies as they are about to settle down to their phlebotomic operations. The larvae of
  the Tabanidae are some <span class="pagenum" id="page483"><span
  class="smaller">{483}</span></span>of them aquatic, but others live in the earth or in decaying
  wood; they are of predaceous habits, attacking and sucking Insect-larvae, or worms. Their form is
  cylindric, attenuate at the two extremities; the slender small head is retractile, and armed with
  a pair of conspicuous, curved black hooks. The body is surrounded by several prominent rings. The
  breathing apparatus is apparently but little developed, and consists of a small tube at the
  extremity of the body, capable of being exserted or withdrawn; in this two closely approximated
  stigmata are placed. In a larva, probably of this family, found by the writer in the shingle of a
  shallow stream in the New Forest, the annuli are replaced by seven circles of prominent
  pseudopods, on the abdominal segments about eight in each circle, and each of these feet is
  surmounted by a crown of small hooks, so that there are fifty or sixty feet distributed equally
  over the middle part of the body without reference to upper or lower surface. The figures of the
  larva of <i>T. cordiger</i>, by Brauer, and of <i>Haematopota pluvialis</i>, by Perris, are
  something like this, but have no setae on the pseudopods. The metamorphoses of several Tabanidae
  are described and figured by Hart;<a id="NtA_403" href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> the pupa is
  remarkably like a Lepidopterous pupa. We have five genera and about a score of species of
  Tabanidae in Britain.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 16. Acanthomeridae.</b>&mdash;A very small family of two genera (<i>Acanthomera</i> and
  <i>Rhaphiorhynchus</i>) confined to America, and including the largest Diptera, some being two
  inches long. The antenna is terminated by a compound of seven segments and a style; the proboscis
  is short, and the squama rudimentary. The general form reminds one of Tabanidae or Oestridae. A
  dried larva exists in the Vienna collection; it is amphipneustic, and very remarkable on account
  of the great size of the anterior stigma.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 17. Therevidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Moderate-sized flies, with somewhat the appearance of
  short Asilidae. They have, however, only a feeble fleshy proboscis, and minute claws, with
  pulvilli but no empodium; the antennae project, are short, three-jointed, pointed.</i>&mdash;The
  flies of this family are believed to be predaceous like the Robber-flies, but they appear to be
  very feebly organised for such a life. We have about ten species in Britain, and there are only
  some 200 known from all the world. But little is known as to the metamorphoses. Meigen found
  larvae of <i>T. nobilitata</i> in rotten stumps, but other larvae have been recorded as devouring
  dead pupae or larvae of Lepidoptera. The larvae are said to be elongate, very slender, worm-like,
  and to have nineteen body-segments, the posterior pair of spiracles being placed on what looks
  like the seventeenth segment, but is really the eighth of the abdomen. The pupa is not enclosed in
  the larval skin; that of <i>Psilocephala</i> is armed with setae and spinous processes, and was
  found in rotten wood by Frauenfeld.</p>

  absent.</i> These unattractive flies form one of the smallest families, and are chiefly found on
  windows. <i>S. fenestralis</i> looks like a tiny Stratiomyid, with a peculiar, dull, metallic
  surface. The larva of this species has been recorded as feeding on a variety of strange
  substances, but Osten Sacken is of opinion<a id="NtA_404" href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> that
  it is really predaceous, and frequents these substances in order to find the larvae that are
  developing in them. If so, <i>Scenopinus</i> is useful in a small way by destroying "moth," etc.
  The larva is a little slender, cylindrical, hard, pale worm of nineteen segments, with a small
  brown head placed like a hook at one extremity of the body and with two short, divergent processes
  at the other extremity, almost exactly like the larva of <i>Thereva</i>. Full references to the
  literature about this Insect are given by Osten Sacken.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 19. Nemestrinidae.</b>&mdash;These Insects appear to be allied to the Bombyliidae.
  <i>They are of medium size, often pilose, and <span class="pagenum" id="page485"><span

  a simple third joint, and a jointed, slender, terminal appendage; the tibiae have no spurs, the
  empodium is pulvillus-like. The wing-nervuration is perhaps the most complex found in Diptera,
  there being numerous cells at the tip, almost after the fashion of Neuroptera.</i> With this
  family we commence the aerial forms composing the Tromoptera of Osten Sacken. Nemestrinidae is a
  small family of about 100 species, but widely distributed. <i>Megistorhynchus longirostris</i> is
  about two-thirds of an inch long, but has a proboscis at least four times as long as itself. In
  South Africa it may be seen endeavouring to extract, with this proboscis, the honey from the
  flower of a <i>Gladiolus</i> that has a perianth just as long as its own rostrum; as it attempts
  to do this when it is hovering on the wing, and as the proboscis is, unlike that of the Bombylii,
  fixed, the Insect can only succeed by controlling its movements with perfect accuracy; hence it
  has great difficulty in attaining its purpose, especially when there is much wind, when it
  frequently strikes the earth instead of the flower. M. Westermann thinks<a id="NtA_405"
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> the life of the Insect and the appearance and duration of the
  flower of the <i>Gladiolus</i> are very closely connected. The life-history of <i>Hirmoneura
  obscura</i> has recently been studied in Austria by Handlirsch and Brauer.<a id="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> The larva is parasitic on the larva of a Lamellicorn beetle
  (<i>Rhizotrogus solstitialis</i>); it is metapneustic, and the head is highly modified for
  predaceous purposes. The young larva apparently differs to a considerable extent from the matured
  form. The most curious fact is that the parent fly does not oviposit near the Lamellicorn-larva,
  but places her eggs in the burrows of some wood-boring Insect in logs; the larvae when hatched
  come to the surface of the log, hold themselves up on their hinder extremity and are carried away
  by the wind; in what manner they come into contact with the Lamellicorn larva, which feeds in
  turf, is unknown. The pupa is remarkable on account of the prominent, almost stalked stigmata, and
  of two pointed divergent processes at the extremity of the body. This life-history is of much
  interest, as it foreshadows to some extent the complex parasitic life-histories of Bombyliidae.
  The Nemestrinidae are not represented in the British fauna.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 20. Bombyliidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Body frequently fringed with down, or covered in large
  part with hair. Legs slender, claws small, without distinct empodium, usually with only minute
  pulvilli. Proboscis very long or moderate, antennae three-jointed, terminal joint not distinctly
  divided, sometimes large, sometimes hair-like.</i> This is a very large family, including 1500
  species, and is of great importance to both naturalist and economist. Two well-marked types,
  formerly treated as distinct families, are included in it&mdash;(1) the Bombyliides with very long
  exserted rostrum, and humped thorax; and (2) Anthracides, with a short beak, and of more slender
  and graceful form. None of these flies are bloodsuckers, they frequent flowers only, and use their
  long rostrums in a harmless manner. The members of both of these groups usually have the wings
  ornamented with a pattern, which in <i>Anthrax</i> is frequently very remarkable; in both, the
  clothing of the body is frequently variegated. Their powers of flight are very great, and the
  hovering <i>Bombylius</i> of early spring is endowed with an unsurpassed capacity for movement,
  remaining perfectly still on the wing, and darting off with lightning rapidity; <i>Anthrax</i> is
  also most rapid on the wing. In Britain we have but few species of Bombyliidae, but in warm and
  dry climates they are very numerous. The life-history of these Insects was till recently unknown,
  but that of <i>Argyromoeba</i> (<i>Anthrax</i>) <i>trifasciata</i> has been described by the
  French naturalist, Fabre, who ascertained that the species is parasitic on the Mason-bee,
  <i>Chalicodoma muraria</i>, that forms nests of solid masonry. He endeavoured to discover the egg,
  but failed; the parent-fly oviposits, it appears, by merely dropping a minute egg while flying
  over the surface of the mass of masonry by which the grubs of the <i>Chalicodoma</i> are
  protected. From this egg there is hatched a minute delicate vermiform larva (Fig. 232, A). In
  order to obtain its food, it is necessary for this feeble creature to penetrate the masonry;
  apparently a hopeless task, the animal <span class="pagenum" id="page487"><span
  class="smaller">{487}</span></span>being scarcely a twentieth of an inch long and very slender; it
  is, however, provided with a deflexed horny head, armed in front with some stiff bristles, while
  on the under surface of the body there are four pairs of elongate setae serving as organs of
  locomotion; thus endowed, the frail creature hunts about the surface of the masonry, seeking to
  find an entrance; frequently it is a long time before it is successful; but though it has never
  taken any food it is possessed of great powers of endurance. Usually, after being disclosed from
  the egg, it remains about fifteen days without stirring; and even after it commences its attempts
  to enter the nest it is still capable of a long life without taking any food. Possibly its
  organisation will not permit it to feed (supposing any food were obtainable by it) without its
  growing somewhat thereafter, and if so, its chance of obtaining entrance through the masonry would
  be diminished. Abstention, it would appear, is the best policy, whether inevitable or not; so the
  starving little larva continues its endeavours to find a chink of entrance to the food contained
  in the interior of the masonry. It has plenty of time for this, because it is better for it not to
  get into the cell of the bee until the grub is quite full grown, and is about to assume the pupal
  form, when it is quite incapable of self-defence. Finally, after greater or less delay, the
  persevering little larva succeeds in finding some tiny gap in the masonry through which it can
  force itself. M. Fabre says that the root of a plant is not more persistent in descending into the
  soil that is to support it than is this little <i>Anthrax</i> in insinuating itself through some
  crack that may admit it to its food. Having once effected an entrance the organisation that has
  enabled it to do so is useless; this primary form of the larva has, in fact, as its sole object to
  enable the creature to penetrate to its food. Having penetrated, it undergoes a complete change of
  form, and appears as a creature specially fitted for feeding on the quiescent larva of the bee
  without destroying it. To accomplish this requires an extreme delicacy of organisation and
  instinct; to bite the prey would be to kill it, and if this were done, the <i>Anthrax</i> would,
  Fabre supposes, ensure its own death, for it cannot feed on the dead and putrefying grub;
  accordingly, the part of its body that does duty as a mouth is merely a delicate sucker which it
  applies to the skin of the <i>Chalicodoma</i>-grub; and thus without inflicting any perceptible
  wound it sucks day <span class="pagenum" id="page488"><span
  class="smaller">{488}</span></span>after day, changing its position frequently, until it has
  completely emptied the pupa of its contents, nothing being left but the skin. Although this is
  accomplished without any wound being inflicted, so effectual is the process that all the
  <i>Chalicodoma</i> is gradually absorbed. The time requisite for completely emptying the victim is
  from twelve to fifteen days; at the end of this time the <i>Anthrax</i>-larva is full grown, and
  the question arises, how is it to escape from the cell of solid masonry in which it is imprisoned?
  It entered this cell as a tiny, slender worm through a minute orifice or crack, but it has now
  much increased in size, and exit for a creature of its organisation is not possible. For some
  months it remains a quiescent larva in the cell of the <i>Chalicodoma</i>, but in the spring of
  the succeeding year it undergoes another metamorphosis, and appears as a pupa provided with a
  formidable apparatus for breaking down the masonry by which it is imprisoned. The head is large
  and covered in front with six hard spines, to be used in striking and piercing the masonry, while
  the other extremity of the body bears some curious horns, the middle segments being armed with
  rigid hairs directed backwards, and thus facilitating movement in a forward direction and
  preventing slipping backwards. The pupa is strongly curved, and fixes itself by the aid of the
  posterior spines; then, unbending itself, it strikes with the armour of the other extremity
  against the opposing wall, which is thus destroyed piecemeal until a gallery of exit is formed;
  when this is completed the pupa-skin bursts and the perfect fly emerges, leaving the pupa-case
  still fixed in the gallery. Thus this species appears in four consecutive forms&mdash;in addition
  to the egg&mdash;each of which is highly specialised for the purposes of existence in that
  stage.</p>

  <p>The habits of our British <i>Bombylius major</i> have been partially observed by Dr. Chapman,<a
  id="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> and exhibit a close analogy with those of
  <i>Anthrax trifasciata</i>. The bee-larva that served as food was in this case <i>Andrena
  labialis</i>, and the egg was deposited by the fly, when hovering, by jerking it against the bank
  in which the nest of the bee was placed.</p>

  <p>It has recently been discovered that the larvae of various species of Bombyliidae are of great
  service by devouring the eggs of locusts. Riley found that the egg-cases of <i>Caloptenus <span
  class="pagenum" id="page489"><span class="smaller">{489}</span></span>spretus</i> are emptied of
  their contents by the larvae of <i>Systoechus oreas</i> and <i>Triodites mus</i>. A similar
  observation has been made in the Troad by Mr. Calvert, who found that the Bombyliid, <i>Callostoma
  fascipennis</i>, destroys large quantities of the eggs of <i>Caloptenus italicus</i>.  Still more
  recently M. K&uuml;nckel d'Herculais has discovered that the destructive locust <i>Stauronotus
  maroccanus</i> is kept in check in Algeria in a similar manner, as many as 80 per cent of the eggs
  of the locust being thus destroyed in certain localities. He observes that the larva of the fly,
  after being full fed in the autumn, passes the winter in a state of lethargy&mdash;he calls it
  "hypnody"&mdash;in the egg-case of the locust, and he further informs us that in the case of
  <i>Anthrax fenestralis</i>, which devours the eggs of the large <i>Ocnerodes</i>, the lethargy may
  be prolonged for a period of three years. After the pupa is formed it works a way out of the case
  by means of its armature, and then again becomes for some days immobile before the perfect fly
  appears.  Lepidopterous larvae are also attacked by Bombyliid flies. A species of <i>Systropus</i>
  has been recorded as destroying the larva of <i>Limacodes</i>. Several of the Bombyliids of the
  genus just mentioned are remarkable for the great resemblance they display to various Hymenoptera,
  some of them being very slender flies, like the thin bodied fossorial Hymenoptera. The difference
  between the pupa and imago in this case is very remarkable (Fig. 233).</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 21. Acroceridae</b> or <b>Cyrtidae</b>.&mdash;<i>Flies of the average size, of peculiar
  form, the small head consisting almost entirely of the eyes, and bent down under the humped
  thorax: wings small, halteres entirely concealed by the very large horizontal squamae; antennae
  very diverse.</i> The peculiar shape of these flies is an exaggeration of that we have already
  noticed in <i>Bombylius</i>. The mouth in Acroceridae is very variable; there may be a very long,
  slender proboscis (<i>Acrocera</i>), or the mouth-parts may be so atrophied that it is doubtful
  whether even an orifice exists (<i>Ogcodes</i>). There are but <span class="pagenum"
  id="page490"><span class="smaller">{490}</span></span>few species known, and all of them are
  rare;<a id="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> in Britain we have but two (<i>Ogcodes
  gibbosus</i>, <i>Acrocera globulus</i>). The genus <i>Pterodontia</i>, found in North America and
  Australia, an inflated bladder-like form with a minute head, is amongst the most extraordinary of
  all the forms of Diptera. The habits are very peculiar, the larvae, so far as known, all living as
  parasites within the bodies of spiders or in their egg-bags. It appears, however, that the flies
  do not oviposit in appropriate places, but place their eggs on stems of plants, and the young
  larvae have to find their way to the spiders. Brauer has described the larva of the European
  <i>Astomella lindeni</i>,<a id="NtA_409" href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> which lives in the
  body of a spider, <i>Cteniza ariana</i>; it is amphipneustic and maggot-like, the head being
  extremely small. The larva leaves the body of the spider for pupation; the pupa is much arched,
  and the head is destitute of the peculiar armature of the Bombyliidae, but has a serrate ridge on
  the thorax. Emerton found the larvae of an <i>Acrocera</i> in the webs of a common North American
  spider, <i>Amaurobius sylvestris</i>, they having eaten, it was supposed, the makers of the
  cobwebs.</p>

  porrect antennae, with a simple, circular third joint, bearing a bristle; empodium very small,
  pulvilli absent.</i>&mdash;Only one genus of these little flies is known, but it is apparently
  widely distributed, and its members are common Insects. They have the appearance of Acalyptrate
  Muscidae, and the nervuration of the wing is somewhat similar, the nervures being simple and
  parallel, and the minute cross-nervures placed near the base. The systematic position is somewhat
  doubtful, and the metamorphoses are but incompletely known, very little having been added to what
  was discovered by Sir John Lubbock in 1862.<a id="NtA_410" href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> The
  larva lives on the earth under vegetable matter; it is very transparent, amphipneustic, with a
  peculiar head, and with fringes on the margins. This larva changes to a semi-pupa or apterous
  maggot-like form, within the larval skin; the true pupa was <span class="pagenum"
  id="page491"><span class="smaller">{491}</span></span>not noticed by Lubbock, but Frauenfeld<a
  id="NtA_411" href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> has since observed it, though he only mentions
  that it possesses differentiated limbs and segments. The metamorphoses appear to be very peculiar.
  This fly requires a thorough study.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 23. Mydaidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Large flies of elongate form; the hind femora long and
  toothed beneath; the antennae knobbed at the tip, projecting, rather long, the basal joint
  definite, but the divisions of the subsequent joints more or less indistinct. Empodium small.
  Wings frequently heavily pigmented; with a complex nervuration.</i> These fine flies are exotic; a
  few species occur in the Mediterranean region, even in the South of Europe; the chief genus,
  <i>Mydas</i>, is South American, but most of the other genera are Australian or African. But
  little is known as to the life-histories. The larvae are thought to live in wood, and to prey on
  Coleopterous larvae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 24. Asilidae</b> (<i>Robber-flies</i>).&mdash;<i>Mouth forming a short, projecting
  horny beak, the palpi usually only small; the feet generally largely developed; the claws large,
  frequently thick and blunt, the pulvilli generally elongate, the empodium a bristle; halteres
  free; no squama.</i> The Asilidae is one of the largest families of flies, and probably includes
  about 3000 described species: as will readily be believed, there is much variety of form; some are
  short and thick and extremely hairy, superficially resembling hairy bees, but the majority are
  more or less elongate, the abdomen being specially long, and having eight segments conspicuously
  displayed. The antennae are variable, but are three-jointed with a terminal appendage of diverse
  form and structure. They belong to the super-family Energopoda of Osten Sacken, but the
  association of Empidae and Dolichopidae with them does not seem to be very natural. In their
  perfect state these flies are most voracious, their prey being Insects, which they seize alive and
  impale with the rostrum. They are amongst the most formidable of foes and fear nothing, wasps or
  other stinging Insects being attacked and mastered by the stronger species without difficulty.
  They have been observed to capture even dragon-flies and tiger-beetles. As is the case with so
  many other Insects that prey on living Insects, the appetite in the Asilidae seems to be
  insatiable; a single individual has been observed to kill eight moths in twenty minutes. They have
  <span class="pagenum" id="page492"><span class="smaller">{492}</span></span>been said to suck
  blood from Vertebrates, but this appears to be erroneous. The metamorphoses of a few species have
  been observed. Perris has called attention to the close alliance between the larvae of Tabanidae
  and of Asilidae,<a id="NtA_412" href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> and it seems at present
  impossible to draw a line of distinction between the two. So far as is known, the larvae of
  Asilidae are terrestrial and predaceous, attacking more particularly the larvae of Coleoptera,
  into which they sometimes bore; in <i>Laphria</i> there are numerous pseudopods, somewhat of the
  kind shown in Fig. 230, but less perfect and without hairs; the head and breathing organs appear
  to be very different. According to Beling's descriptions of the larvae of <i>Asilus</i>, the head
  in this case is more like that of the figure, but there are no pseudopods. The flies of Asilidae
  and Tabanidae are so very distinct that these resemblances between their larvae are worthy of
  note.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 25. Apioceridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Moderate-sized flies marked with black and white, with an
  appearance like that of some Muscidae and Asilidae; with clear wings, the veins not deeply
  coloured; antennae short, with a short, simple appendage; no empodium.</i> But little is known as
  to the flies of this family, of which only two genera, consisting of about a dozen species, are
  found in North America, Chili, and Australia. Osten Sacken is inclined to treat them as an
  aberrant division of Asilidae. Brauer looks on them as primitive or synthetic forms of much
  interest, and has briefly described a larva which he considers may be that of <i>Apiocera</i>, but
  this is doubtful; it is a twenty-segmented form, and may be that of a <i>Thereva</i>.<a
  id="NtA_413" href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 26. Empidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Small or moderate-sized flies of obscure colours, grey,
  rusty, or black, with small head, somewhat globular in form, with three-jointed antennae, the
  terminal joint long and pointed; usually there is a long slender beak; the legs are elongate,
  frequently hairy; the tarsi bear long pulvilli and a small empodium.</i> The Empidae are an
  extensive family of flies, with predaceous habits, the rostrum being used by the female as an
  instrument for impaling and sucking other flies. They are occasionally very numerous in
  individuals, especially in wooded districts. There is great variety; there are nearly 200 species
  in Britain. The forms placed in the sub-family Hybotinae are curious slender little Insects, with
  very convex thorax and <span class="pagenum" id="page493"><span
  class="smaller">{493}</span></span>large hind legs. In <i>Hemerodromia</i> the front legs are
  raptorial, the femora being armed with spines on which the tibiae close so as to form a sort of
  trap. Many Empidae execute a&euml;rial dances, and some of the species of the genus <i>Hilara</i> are
  notorious for carrying veils or nets in the form of silken webs more or less densely woven. This
  subject is comparatively new, the fact having been discovered by Baron Osten Sacken in 1877,<a
  id="NtA_414" href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> and it is not at all clear what purpose these
  peculiar constructions serve; it appears probable that they are carried by means of the hind legs,
  and only by the males. Mik thinks that in <i>H. sartor</i> the veil acts as a sort of parachute,
  and is of use in carrying on the a&euml;rial performance, or enhancing its effect; while in the case of
  other species, <i>H. maura</i> and <i>H. interstincta</i>, the object appears to be the capture or
  retention of prey, after the manner of spiders. The source of the silk is not known, and in fact
  all the details are insufficiently ascertained. The larvae of Empidae are described as cylindrical
  maggots, with very small head, and imperfect ventral feet; the stigmata are amphipneustic, the
  thoracic pair being, however, excessively small; beneath the posterior pair there is nearly always
  a tooth- or spine-like prominence present.</p>

  and second basal cells, which therefore form but one cell.</i> This is also a very extensive
  family of flies, of which we have probably about 200 species in Britain. They are conspicuous on
  account of their golden, or golden-green colours, only a few being yellow or black. <span

  the curious special characters they possess on the feet, antennae, face, or wings. These

  their metamorphoses. Some of the larvae frequent trees, living under the bark or in the
  overflowing sap, and are believed to be carnivorous; they are amphipneustic; a cocoon is formed,

  approximate veins, meeting on the front margin near its middle, and besides these, three or four
  very fine veins, that run to the margins in a sub-parallel manner without forming any cells or
  forks.</i> This obscure family of flies is of small extent, but its members are extremely common
  in Europe and North America, where they often occur in numbers running on the windows of houses.
  It is one of the most isolated groups of Diptera, and great difference of opinion prevails as to
  its classification. The wing-nervuration is peculiar (but varies somewhat in the species), the
  total absence of any cross-veins even on the basal part of the wing being remarkable. There are
  bristles on the head and thorax, but they are not arranged in a regular manner. The larvae live in
  a great variety of animal and vegetable decaying matter, <span class="pagenum" id="page495"><span

  larva the segmentation is distinct, and from the fourth segment there project two slender
  processes. These are breathing organs, attached to the prothorax of the imprisoned pupa; in what
  manner they effect a passage through the hardened larval skin is by no means clear. Perris
  supposes that holes for them pre-exist in the larval skin, and that the newly-formed pupa by
  restless movements succeeds in bringing the processes into such a position that they can pass
  through the holes. The dehiscence of the puparium seems to occur in a somewhat irregular manner,

  cannot at present be classified. It is completely apterous; the arrangement of the body-segments
  is unlike that of Diptera, but the antennae and mouth-parts are said to be like those of Phoridae.
  The Insect was found near Copenhagen under a stone in the runs of <i>Formica fusca</i>. Meinert
  thinks it possible that the discovery of the male may prove <i>Aenigmatias</i> to be really allied
  to Phoridae, and Mik suggests that it may be the same as <i>Platyphora lubbocki</i>, Verrall,
  known to be parasitic on ants. Dahl recently described a wingless Dipteron, found living as a
  parasite on land-snails in the Bismarck archipelago, under the name of <i>Puliciphora
  lucifera</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page496"><span class="smaller">{496}</span></span>and
  Wandolleck has recently made for this and some allies the new family Stethopathidae. It seems
  doubtful whether these forms are more than wingless Phoridae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 29. Platypezidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Small flies, with porrect three-jointed antennae, first
  two joints short, third longer, with a terminal seta; no bristles on the back; hind legs of male,
  or of both sexes, with peculiar, broad, flat tarsi; the middle tibiae bear spurs; there is no
  empodium.</i> Platypezidae is a small family of flies, the classification of which has always been
  a matter of considerable difficulty, and is still uncertain. The larvae are broad and flat,
  fringed at the margin with twenty-six spines; they live between the lamellae of Agaric fungi. At
  pupation the form alters but little; the imago emerges by a horizontal cleft occurring at the
  margins of segments two and four.<a id="NtA_419" href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> We have four
  genera (<i>Opetia</i>, <i>Platycnema</i>, <i>Platypeza</i>, <i>Callomyia</i>), and nearly a score
  of species of Platypezidae in our British list, but very little seems to be known about them.
  There is much difference in the eyes of the sexes, in some at any rate of the species, they being
  large and contiguous in the male, but widely separated in the female.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 30. Pipunculidae.</b><a id="NtA_420" href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Small
  flies, with very short antennae bearing a long seta that is not terminal; head almost globular,
  formed, except at the back, almost entirely by the large conjoined eyes; the head is only slightly
  smaller in the female, but in the male the eyes are more approximate at the top.</i> This is
  another of the small families of flies, that seems distinct from any other, though possessing no
  very important characters. In many of the flies that have very large eyes, the head is either
  flattened (<i>i.e.</i> compressed from before backwards, as in Tabanidae, Asilidae), or forced
  beneath the humped thorax (as in Acroceridae), but neither of these conditions exists in
  <i>Pipunculus</i>; in them the head extends far forwards, so that the area of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page497"><span class="smaller">{497}</span></span>eye compared with the size
  of the body is perhaps greater than in any other Diptera. The general form is somewhat that of
  <i>Anthrax</i>, but the venation on the hind part of the wing is much less complex. There is a
  remarkable difference between the facets on the front and the back of these great eyes. We have
  three genera and about a dozen species of Pipunculidae in Britain but apparently they are far from
  common Insects. What is known about the life-history is almost confined to an imperfect
  observation by Boheman, who found the larva of <i>P. fuscipes</i> living after the manner of a
  Hymenopterous parasite in the body of a small Homopterous Insect.<a id="NtA_421"
  href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> The pupa seems to be of the type of that of Syrphidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 31. Conopidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Elegant flies of moderate size, of varied colours, with
  abdomen slender at the base, at the tip strongly incurved and thicker; antennae inserted close
  together on a prominence, three-jointed, first joint sometimes very short. The upper surface of
  the body without bristles or with but few. There is a slender, elongate proboscis, which is
  retractile and usually invisible.</i> This rather small family of flies includes some of the most
  remarkable forms of Diptera; it includes two divisions, the Conopinae with long antennae
  terminated by a very minute pointed process, and Myopinae with shorter antennae bearing a hair
  that is not placed at the end of the third joint. The former are the more wasp-like and elegant;
  the Myopinae being much more like ordinary flies, though they frequently have curious, inflated
  heads, with a white face. The mode of life of the larva of <i>Conops</i> is peculiar, it being
  parasitic in the interior of <i>Bombus</i>, or other Hymenoptera. They have been found to attack
  <i>Bombus</i>, <i>Chalicodoma</i>, <i>Osmia</i>, <i>Vespa</i>, <i>Pompilus</i>, and other
  Aculeates. Williston says that Orthoptera are also attacked. <i>Conops</i> has been seen to follow
  Bumble-bees and alight on them, and Williston says this act is accompanied by oviposition, the
  larva that is hatched boring its way into the body of the bee. Others have supposed that the flies
  enter the bees' nests and place their eggs in the larvae or pupae; but this is uncertain, for
  <i>Conops</i> has never been reared from a bee-larva or pupa, though it has frequently been
  procured from the imago: cases indeed having been recorded in which <i>Conops</i> has emerged from
  the body <span class="pagenum" id="page498"><span class="smaller">{498}</span></span>of a
  <i>Bombus</i> several months after the latter had been killed and placed in an entomologist's
  collection. The larva is broad, and when full grown apparently occupies nearly all the space of
  the interior of the abdomen of the bee; it has very peculiar terminal stigmata. The pupa is formed
  in the larval skin, which is greatly shortened and indurated for the purpose; this instar bears,
  in addition to the posterior stigmata, a pair of slightly projecting, anterior stigmata. We have
  several species of Conopidae in Britain; those belonging to the division Conopinae are all rare
  Insects, but the Myopinae are not so scarce; these latter are believed to be of similar habits
  with the Conopinae, though remarkably little is known about them. This is another of the numerous
  families, the relations of which are still a subject for elucidation. Brauer places the Conopidae
  in his section Schizophora away from Syrphidae, but we do not comprehend on what grounds; an
  inspection of the head shows that there is no frontal lunule as there is in Eumyiidae; both
  <i>Myopa</i> and <i>Conops</i> agreeing fairly well with <i>Syrphus</i> as to this. We therefore
  place the family in its old position near <i>Syrphus</i> till the relations with Acalypterate
  Muscidae shall be better established.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 32. Syrphidae</b> (<i>Hover-flies</i>).&mdash;<i>Of moderate or rather large size,
  frequently spotted or banded with yellow, with a thick fleshy proboscis capable of being withdrawn
  into a cleft on the under side of the head; antennae not placed in definite cavities,
  three-jointed (usually very short), and leaving a seta that is not terminal in position, and may
  be feathered. Squama variable, never entirely covering the halteres; the chief (third to fifth)
  longitudinal veins of the wings connected near their termination by cross-veins and usually thus
  forming a sort of short margin parallel with the hind edge of the wing; a more or less imperfect
  false nervure running between the third and fourth longitudinal nervures; no empodium and
  generally no distinct system of bristles on the back of the body.</i> The Syrphidae (Fig. 212)
  form one of the largest and best known of all the families of flies; they abound in our gardens
  where, in sunny weather, some species may be nearly always seen hovering over flowers, or beneath
  trees in places where the rays of the sun penetrate amidst the shade. There are two or three
  thousand species known, so that of course much variety exists; some are densely covered with hair
  (certain <i>Volucella</i> and others), many are of elegant form, and some bear a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page499"><span class="smaller">{499}</span></span>considerable resemblance to
  Hymenoptera of various groups. The peculiar veining of the wings permits of their easy
  identification, the line of two nervules, approximately parallel with the margin of the distal
  part of the wing (Fig. 212, D), and followed by a deep bay, being eminently characteristic, though
  there are some exceptions; there are a few forms in which the antennae are exceptional in having a
  terminal pointed process. The proboscis, besides the membranous and fleshy lips, consists of a
  series of pointed slender lancets, the use of which it is difficult to comprehend, as the Insects
  are not known to pierce either animals or vegetables, their food being chiefly pollen; honey is
  also doubtless taken by some species, but the lancet-like organs appear equally ill-adapted for
  dealing with it. The larvae are singularly diversified; first, there are the eaters of Aphidae, or
  green-fly; some of these may be generally found on our rose-bushes or on thistles, when they are
  much covered with Aphids; they are soft, maggot-like creatures with a great capacity for changing
  their shape and with much power of movement, especially of the anterior part of the body, which is
  stretched out and moved about to obtain and spear their prey: some of them are very transparent,
  so that the movements of the internal organs and their vivid colours can readily be seen: like so
  many other carnivorous Insects, their voracity appears to be insatiable. The larvae of many of the
  ordinary Hover-flies are of this kind. <i>Eristalis</i> and its allies are totally different, they
  live in water saturated with filth, or with decaying vegetable matter (the writer has found many
  hundreds of the larvae of <i>Myiatropa florea</i> in a pool of water standing in a hollow
  beech-tree). These rat-tailed maggots are of great interest, but as they have been described in
  almost every work on entomology, and as Professor Miall<a id="NtA_422"
  href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> has recently given an excellent account of their
  peculiarities, we need not now discuss them. Some of the flies of the genus <i>Eristalis</i> are
  very like honey-bees, and appear in old times to have been confounded with them; indeed, Osten
  Sacken thinks this resemblance gave rise to the "Bugonia myth," a fable of very ancient origin to
  the effect that Honey-bees could be procured from filth, or even putrefying carcases, by the aid
  of certain proceedings that savoured slightly of witchcraft, and may therefore have increased the
  belief of the operator in the <span class="pagenum" id="page500"><span
  class="smaller">{500}</span></span>possibility of a favourable result. It was certainly not bees
  that were produced from the carcases, but Osten Sacken suggests that <i>Eristalis</i>-flies may
  have been bred therein.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Volucella</i> we meet with a third kind of Syrphid larva. These larvae are
  pallid, broad and fleshy, surrounded by numerous angular, somewhat spinose, outgrowths of the
  body; and have behind a pair of combined stigmata, in the neighbourhood of which the outgrowths
  are somewhat larger; these larvae live in the nests of Bees and Wasps, in which they are abundant.
  Some of the <i>Volucella</i>, like many other Syrphidae, bear a considerable resemblance to Bees
  or Wasps, and this has given rise to a modern fable about them that appears to have no more
  legitimate basis of fact than the ancient Bees-born-of-carcases myth. It was formerly assumed that
  the <i>Volucella</i>-larvae lived on the larvae of the Bees, and that the parent flies were
  providentially endowed with a bee-like appearance that they might obtain entrance into the Bees'
  nests without being detected, and then carry out their nefarious intention of laying eggs that
  would hatch into larvae and subsequently destroy the larvae of the Bees. Some hard-hearted critic
  remarked that it was easy to understand that providence should display so great a solicitude for
  the welfare of the <i>Volucella</i>, but that it was difficult to comprehend how it could be, at
  the same time, so totally indifferent to the welfare of the Bees. More recently the tale has been
  revived and cited as an instance of the value of deceptive resemblance resulting from the action
  of natural selection, without reference to providence. There are, however, no facts to support any
  theory on the subject. Very little indeed is actually known as to the habits of <i>Volucella</i>
  in either the larval or imaginal instars; but the little that is known tends to the view that the
  presence of the <i>Volucella</i> in the nests is advantageous to both Fly and Bee. Nicolas has
  seen <i>Volucella zonaria</i> enter the nest of a Wasp; it settled at a little distance and walked
  in without any fuss being made. Ern&eacute; has watched the <i>Volucella</i>-larvae in the nests, and he
  thinks that they eat the waste or dejections of the larvae. The writer kept under observation
  <i>Volucella</i>-larvae and portions of the cells of <i>Bombus</i>, containing some larvae and
  pupae of the Bees and some honey, but the fly-larvae did not during some weeks touch any of the
  Bees or honey, and ultimately died, presumably of starvation. Subsequently, he experimented with
  <i>Volucella</i>-larvae and a portion <span class="pagenum" id="page501"><span
  class="smaller">{501}</span></span>of the comb of wasps containing pupae, and again found that the
  flies did not attack the Hymenoptera; but on breaking a pupa of the Wasp in two, the fly-larvae
  attacked it immediately and eagerly; so that the evidence goes to show that the
  <i>Volucella</i>-larvae act as scavengers in the nests of the Hymenoptera. K&uuml;nckel d'Herculais has
  published an elaborate work on the European <i>Volucella</i>; it is remarkable for the beauty of
  the plates illustrating the structure, anatomy and development, but throws little direct light on
  the natural history of the Insects. <i>V. bombylans</i>, one of the most abundant of our British
  species, appears in two forms, each of which has a considerable resemblance to a <i>Bombus</i>,
  and it has been supposed that each of the two forms is specially connected with the Bee it
  resembles, but there is no evidence to support this idea; indeed, there is some little evidence to
  the contrary. The genus <i>Merodon</i> has larvae somewhat similar to those of <i>Volucella</i>,
  but they live in bulbs of <i>Narcissus</i>; <i>M. equestris</i> has been the cause of much loss to
  the growers of Dutch bulbs; this Fly is interesting on account of its great variation in colour;
  it has been described as a whole series of distinct species.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable of the numerous forms of Syrphid larvae are those of the genus
  <i>Microdon</i> (Fig. 239), which live in ants' nests. They have no resemblance to Insect-larvae,
  and when first discovered were not only supposed to be little Molluscs, but were actually
  described as such under the generic names of <i>Parmula</i> and <i>Scutelligera</i>. There is no
  appearance of segmentation of the body; the upper surface is covered by a sort of network formed
  by curved setae, which help to retain a coating of dirt; there is no trace externally of any head,
  but on the under surface there is a minute fold in which such mouth-organs as may be present are
  probably concealed; the sides of the body project so as to form a complex fringing arrangement;
  the terminal stigmata are very distinct, the lateral processes connected with them (the "Knospen"
  of Dr. Meijere), are, however, very irregular and placed at some distance from the stigmatic scar.
  Pupation occurs by the induration of the external covering and the growth from it, or rather
  through it, of two short horns in front. Inside this skin there is formed a soft pupa, of the kind
  usual in Cyclorrhaphous flies; the dehiscence of the external covering is, however, of unusual
  nature, three little pieces being <span class="pagenum" id="page502"><span
  class="smaller">{502}</span></span>separated from the anterior part of the upper surface, while
  the lower face remains intact. The account of the pupation given by Elditt<a id="NtA_423"
  href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> is not complete: the two horns that project are, it would
  appear, not portions of the larval skin, but belong to the head of the pupa, and according to
  Elditt are used to effect the dehiscence of the case for the escape of the fly; there does not
  appear to be any head-vesicle. Nothing is known as to the details of the life of these anomalous
  larvae. M. Poujade has described two species found in France in the nests of the ant <i>Lasius
  niger</i>.<a id="NtA_424" href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> The larva we figure was found by
  Colonel Yerbury in nests of an <i>Atta</i> in Portugal, and an almost identical larva was recently
  found by Mr. Budgett in Paraguay. The flies themselves are scarce, <i>Microdon mutabilis</i>
  (formerly called <i>M. apiformis</i>) being one of the rarest of British flies. They have the
  antennae longer than is usual in Syrphidae, and the cross-veins at the outside of the wing are
  irregularly placed, so that the contour is very irregular: the resemblance to bees is very marked,
  and in some of the South American forms the hind legs are flattened and hairy like those of bees.
  The oviposition of <i>Microdon</i> has been observed by Verhoeff;<a id="NtA_425"
  href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> he noticed that the fly was frequently driven away by the
  ants&mdash;in this case, <i>Formica sanguinea</i>&mdash;but returned undiscouraged to its
  task.</p>

  class="smaller">{503}</span></span>wants elucidation. Whether the Syrphidae, or some of them,

  <p><b>Fam. 33. Muscidae acalyptratae.</b>&mdash;This group of flies has been the least studied of
  all the Diptera; it is generally treated as composed of twenty or thirty different families
  distinguished by very slight characters. It is, however, generally admitted by systematists that
  these assemblages have not the value of the families of the other divisions of Diptera, and some
  even go so far as to say that they are altogether only equivalent to a single family. We do not
  therefore think it necessary to define each one <i>seriatim</i>; we shall merely mention their
  names, and allude to certain points of interest connected with them. Taken collectively they may
  be defined as very <i>small flies, with three-jointed antennae (frequently looking as if only
  two-jointed), bearing a bristle that is not terminally placed; frequently either destitute of
  squamae or having these imperfectly developed so as not to cover the halteres; and possessing a
  comparatively simple system of nervuration, the chief nervures being nearly straight, so that
  consequently few cells are formed</i>. These characters will distinguish the group <span

  except from forms of Aschiza, and from certain Anthomyiidae, with both of which the Acalyptratae

  <p>Brauer associates Conopidae with Acalyptrate Muscids, and calls the Group Holometopa; applying
  the term Schizometopa to the Calyptrate Muscidae.</p>

  <p>No generalisation can yet be made as to the larvae of these divisions, neither can any
  characters be pointed out by which they can be distinguished from the larvae of the following
  families. In their habits they have nothing specially distinctive, and may be said to resemble the
  Anthomyiidae, vegetable matter being more used as food than animal; many of them mine in the
  leaves or stems of plants; in the genus <i>Dorycera</i> the larva is aquatic, mining in the leaves
  of water-plants, and in Ephydridae several kinds of aquatic larvae are found, some of which are
  said to resemble the rat-tailed larvae of Syrphidae; certain of these larvae occur in prodigious
  quantities in lakes, and the Insects in some of their early stages serve the Mexicans as food, the
  eggs being called Ahuatle, the larvae Pusci, the pupae Koo-chah-bee. Some of the larvae of the
  Sciomyzidae are also aquatic: that of <i>Tetanocera ferruginea</i> is said by Dufour to consist
  only of eight segments, and to be metapneustic; Brauer considers the Acalyptrate larvae to be,
  however, in general, amphipneustic, like those of Calyptratae. The Chloropidae are a very
  important family owing to their occasional excessive multiplication, and to their living on
  cereals and other grasses, various parts of which they attack, sometimes causing great losses to
  the agriculturist. The species of the genus <i>Chlorops</i> are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page505"><span class="smaller">{505}</span></span>famous for the curious habit of entering
  human habitations in great swarms: frequently many millions being found in a single apartment.
  Instances of this habit have been recorded both in France and England, Cambridge being perhaps the
  place where the phenomenon is most persistently exhibited. In the year 1831 an enormous swarm of
  <i>C. lineata</i> was found in the Provost's Lodge at King's College and was recorded by Leonard
  Jenyns; in 1870 another swarm occurred in the same house if not in the same room.<a id="NtA_428"
  href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> Of late years such swarms have occurred in certain apartments
  in the Museums (which are not far from King's College), and always in the same apartments. No clue
  whatever can be obtained as to their origin; and the manner in which these flies are guided to a
  small area in numbers that must be seen to be believed, is most mysterious. These swarms always
  occur in the autumn, and it has been suggested that the individuals are seeking winter
  quarters.</p>

  <p>Several members of the Acalyptratae have small wings or are wingless, as in some of our species
  of <i>Borborus</i>. The Diopsidae&mdash;none of which are European&mdash;have the sides of the
  head produced into long horns, at the extremity of which are placed the eyes and antennae; these
  curiosities (Fig. 240) are apparently common in both Hindostan and Africa. In the horned flies of
  the genus <i>Elaphomyia</i>, parts of the head are prolonged into horns of very diverse forms
  according to the species, but bearing on the whole a great resemblance to miniature stag-horns. A
  genus (<i>Giraffomyia</i>) with a long neck, and with partially segmented appendages, instead of
  horns on the head, has been recently discovered by Dr. Arthur Willey in New Britain. Equally
  remarkable are the species of <i>Celyphus</i>; they do not look like flies at all, owing to the
  scutellum being inflated and enlarged so as to cover all the posterior parts <span class="pagenum"
  id="page506"><span class="smaller">{506}</span></span>of the body as in the Scutellerid Hemiptera:
  the wings are entirely concealed, and the abdomen is reduced to a plate, with its orifice beneath,
  not terminal; the surface of the body is highly polished and destitute of bristles. Whether this
  is a mimetic form, occurring in association with similar-looking Bugs is not known. The North
  American genus <i>Toxotrypana</i> is furnished with a long ovipositor; and in this and in the
  shape of the body resembles the parasitic Hymenoptera. This genus was placed by Gerstaecker in
  Ortalidae, but is considered by later writers to be a member of the Trypetidae. This latter family
  is of considerable extent, and is remarkable amongst the Diptera for the way in which the wings of
  many of its members are ornamented by an elaborate system of spots or marks, varying according to
  the species.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 34. Anthomyiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Flies similar in appearance to the House-fly; the main
  vein posterior to the middle of the wing (4th longitudinal) continued straight to the margin, not
  turned upwards. Eyes of the male frequently large and contiguous, bristle of antenna either
  feathery or bare.</i> This very large family of flies is one of the most difficult and
  unattractive of the Order. Many of its members come close to the Acalyptrate Muscidae from which
  they are distinguished by the fact that a well-developed squama covers the halteres; others come
  quite as close to the Tachinidae, Muscidae and Sarcophagidae, but may readily be separated by the
  simple, not angulate, main vein of the wing. The larval habits are varied. Many attack vegetables,
  produce disintegration in them, thus facilitating decomposition. <i>Anthomyia brassicae</i> is
  renowned amongst market gardeners on account of its destructive habits. <i>A. cana</i>, on the
  contrary, is beneficial by destroying the migratory Locust <i>Schistocerca peregrina</i>; and in
  North America, <i>A. angustifrons</i> performs a similar office with <i>Caloptenus spretus</i>.
  One or two species have been found living in birds; in one case on the head of a species of
  <i>Spermophila</i>, in another case on a tumour of the wing of a Woodpecker. <i>Hylemyia
  strigosa</i>, a dung-frequenting species, has the peculiar habit of producing living larvae, one
  at a time; these larvae are so large that it would be supposed they are full grown, but this is
  not the case, they are really only in the first stage, an unusual amount of growth being
  accomplished in this stadium. <i>Spilogaster angelicae</i>, on the other hand, according to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page507"><span class="smaller">{507}</span></span>Portschinsky, lays a small
  number of very large eggs, and the resulting larvae pass from the first to the third stage of
  development, omitting the second stage that is usual in Eumyiid Muscidae.<a id="NtA_429"

  <p><b>Fam. 35. Tachinidae.</b>&mdash;<i>First posterior cell of wing nearly or quite closed.
  Squamae large, covering the halteres: antennal arista bare: upper surface of body usually
  bristly.</i> This is an enormous family of flies, the larvae of which live parasitically in other
  living Insects, Lepidopterous larvae being especially haunted. Many have been reared from the
  Insects in which they live, but beyond this little is known of the life-histories, and still less
  of the structure of the larvae of the Tachinidae, although these Insects are of the very first
  importance in the economy of Nature. The eggs are usually deposited by the parent-flies near or on
  the head of the victim; Riley supposed that the fly buzzes about the victim and deposits an egg
  with rapidity, but a circumstantial account given by Weeks<a id="NtA_430"
  href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> discloses a very different process: the fly he watched sat on
  a leaf quietly facing a caterpillar of <i>Datana</i> engaged in feeding at a distance of rather
  less than a quarter of an inch. "Seizing a moment when the head of the larva was likely to remain
  stationary, the fly stealthily and rapidly bent her abdomen downward and extended from the last
  segment what proved to be an ovipositor. This passed forward beneath her body and between the legs
  until it projected beyond and nearly on a level with the head of the fly and came in contact with
  the eye of the larva upon which an egg was deposited," making an addition to five already there.
  <i>Ugimyia sericariae</i> does great <span class="pagenum" id="page508"><span
  class="smaller">{508}</span></span>harm in Japan by attacking the silkworm, and in the case of
  this fly the eggs are believed to be introduced into the victim by being laid on mulberry leaves
  and swallowed with the food; several observers agree as to the eggs being laid on the leaves, but
  the fact that they are swallowed by the silkworm is not so certain. Sasaki has given an extremely
  interesting account of the development of this larva.<a id="NtA_431"
  href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> According to him, the young larva, after hatching in the
  alimentary canal, bores through it, and enters a nerve-ganglion, feeding there for about a week,
  after which the necessity for air becoming greater, as usual with larvae, the maggot leaves the
  nervous system and enters the tracheal system, boring into a tube near a stigmatic orifice of the
  silkworm, where it forms a chamber for itself by biting portions of the tissues and fastening them
  together with saliva. In this it completes its growth, feeding on the interior of the silkworm
  with its anterior part, and breathing through the stigmatic orifice of its host; after this it
  makes its exit and buries itself deeply in the ground, where it pupates. The work of rupturing the
  puparium by the use of the ptilinum is fully described by Sasaki, and also the fact that the fly
  mounts to the surface of the earth by the aid of this same peculiar air-bladder, which is
  alternately contracted and distended. Five, or more, of the <i>Ugimyia</i>-maggots may be found in
  one caterpillar, but only one of them reaches maturity, and emerges from the body. The Tachinid
  flies appear to waste a large proportion of their eggs by injudicious oviposition; but they make
  up for this by the wide circle of their victims, for a single species has been known to infest
  Insects of two or three different Orders.</p>

  <p>The species of <i>Miltogramma</i>&mdash;of which there are many in Europe and two in
  England&mdash;live at the expense of Fossorial <span class="pagenum" id="page509"><span
  class="smaller">{509}</span></span>Hymenoptera by a curious sort of indirect parasitism. They are
  obscure little flies, somewhat resembling the common House-fly, but they are adepts on the wing
  and have the art of ovipositing with extreme rapidity; they follow a Hymenopteron as it is
  carrying the prey to the nest for its young. When the wasp alights on the ground at the entrance
  to the nest, the <i>Miltogramma</i> swoops down and rapidly deposits one or more eggs on the prey
  the wasp designs as food for its own young. Afterwards the larvae of the fly eat up the food, and
  in consequence of the greater rapidity of their growth, the young of the Hymenopteron perishes.
  Some of them are said to deposit living larvae, not eggs. Fabre has drawn a very interesting
  picture of the relations that exist between a species of <i>Miltogramma</i> and a Fossorial Wasp
  of the genus <i>Bembex</i><a id="NtA_432" href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a>. We may remind the
  reader that this Hymenopteron has not the art of stinging its victims so as to keep them alive,
  and that it accordingly feeds its young by returning to the nest at proper intervals with a fresh
  supply of food, instead of provisioning the nest once and for all and then closing it. This
  Hymenopteron has a habit of catching the largest and most active flies&mdash;especially
  Tabanidae&mdash;for the benefit of its young, and it would therefore be supposed that it would be
  safe from the parasitism of a small and feeble fly. On the contrary, the <i>Miltogramma</i> adapts
  its tactics to the special case, and is in fact aided in doing so by the wasp itself. As if
  knowing that the wasp will return to the carefully-closed nest, the <i>Miltogramma</i> waits near
  it, and quietly selects the favourable moment, when the wasp is turning round to enter the nest
  backwards, and deposits eggs on the prey. It appears from Fabre's account that the <i>Bembex</i>
  is well aware of the presence of the fly, and would seem to entertain a great dread of it, as if
  conscious that it is a formidable enemy; nevertheless the wasp never attacks the little fly, but
  allows it sooner or later to accomplish its purpose, and will, it appears, even continue to feed
  the fly-larvae, though they are the certain destroyers of its own young, thus repeating the
  relations between cuckoo and sparrow. Most of us think the wasp stupid, and find its relations to
  the fly incredible or contemptible. Fabre takes a contrary view, and looks on it as a superior
  Uncle Toby. We sympathise with the charming French naturalist, without forming an opinion.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page510"><span class="smaller">{510}</span></span></div>

  <p>Doubtless there are many other interesting features to be found in the life-histories of
  Tachinidae, for in numbers they are legion. It is probable that we may have 200 species in
  Britain, and in other parts of the world they are even more abundant, about 1000 species being
  known in North America.<a id="NtA_433" href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> The family Actiidae is
  at present somewhat doubtful. According to Karsch,<a id="NtA_434"
  href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> it is a sub-family of Tachinidae; but the fourth longitudinal
  vein, it appears, is straight.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 36. Dexiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>These Insects are distinguished from Tachinidae by the
  bristle of the antennae being pubescent, and the legs usually longer.</i> The larvae, so far as
  known, are found in various Insects, especially in Coleoptera, and have also been found in snails.
  There are eleven British genera, and about a score of species.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 37. Sarcophagidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Distinguished from Muscidae and Tachinidae by little
  more than that the bristle of the antennae is feathery at the base but hair-like and very fine at
  the tip.</i>&mdash;<i>Sarcophaga carnaria</i> is one of the commonest British Insects; it is like
  the Blow-fly, though rather longer, conspicuously grey and black, with the thorax distinctly
  striped, and the pulvilli very conspicuous in the live fly. <i>Cynomyia mortuorum</i> is a bright
  blue fly rather larger than the Blow-fly, of which it is a competitor; but in this country an
  unsuccessful one. The larvae of the two Insects are found together, and are said to be quite
  indistinguishable. <i>Cynomyia</i> is said to lay only about half the number of eggs that the
  Blow-fly does, but it appears earlier in the year, and to this is attributed the fact that it is
  not altogether crowded out of existence by the more prolific <i>Calliphora</i>. The species of
  Sarcophagidae are usually viviparous, and one of them, <i>Sarcophila magnifica</i>
  (<i>wohlfahrti</i>), has the habit of occasionally depositing its progeny in the nostrils of
  mammals, and even of human beings, causing horrible sufferings and occasionally death: it is said
  to be not uncommon in Europe but does not occur in Britain. The genus <i>Sarcophaga</i> is
  numerous in species, and many of them are beneficial. Sir Sidney Saunders found in the Troad that
  Locusts were destroyed by the larvae of a <i>Sarcophaga</i> living in their bodies; and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page511"><span class="smaller">{511}</span></span>K&uuml;nckel has recently
  observed that in Algeria several species of this genus attack Locusts and destroy large quantities
  by depositing living larvae in the Orthoptera. In North America the Army-worm is decimated by
  species of <i>Sarcophaga</i>.</p>

  <p>Many of these Insects, when food is scarce, eat their own species with eagerness, and it seems
  probable that this habit is beneficial to the species. The parent-fly in such cases usually
  deposits more eggs than there is food for, thus ensuring that every portion of the food will be
  rapidly consumed, after which the partially-grown larvae complete their development by the aid of
  cannibalism. It is thus ensured that the food will raise up as many individuals as possible.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 38. Muscidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Bristle of antennae feathered.</i> This family contains many
  of the most abundant flies, including the House-fly, Blue-bottles or Blow-flies, Green-bottles,
  and other forms which, though very common, are perhaps not discriminated from one another by those
  who are not entomologists. The larvae live on carrion and decaying or excrementitious matters. The
  common House-fly, <i>Musca domestica</i>, runs through its life-history in a very short time. It
  lays about 150 very small eggs on dung or any kind of soft damp filth; the larvae hatch in a day
  or two and feed on the refuse; they may be full-grown in five or six days, and, then pupating, may
  in another week emerge as perfect flies. Hence it is no wonder that they increase to enormous
  numbers in favourable climates. They are thought to pass the winter chiefly in the pupal state.
  The House-fly is now very widely distributed over the world; it sometimes occurs in large numbers
  away from the dwellings of man. Of Blow-flies there are two common species in this country,
  <i>Calliphora erythrocephala</i> and <i>C. vomitoria</i>. The Green-bottle flies, of which there
  are several species, belonging to the genus <i>Lucilia</i>, have the same habits as Blow-flies,
  though they do not commonly enter houses. The larvae are said to be indistinguishable from those
  of <i>Calliphora</i>.</p>

  <p>The larvae of Eumyiid Muscidae are, when first hatched, metapneustic, but subsequently an
  anterior pair of stigmata appears, so that the larva becomes amphipneustic. They usually go
  through three stages, distinguished by the condition of the posterior stigmata. In the early
  instar these have a single heart-shaped fissure, in the second stage two fissures exist, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page512"><span class="smaller">{512}</span></span>while in the third instar
  there is a greater diversity in the condition of the breathing apertures.</p>

  <p>The various forms of Muscidae show considerable distinctions in the details of their natural
  history, and these in certain species vary according to the locality. This subject has been
  chiefly studied by Portschinsky, a Russian naturalist, and a very interesting summary of his
  results has been given by Osten Sacken,<a id="NtA_435" href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> to
  which the student interested in the subject will do well to refer.</p>

  <p>A few years ago a great deal of damage was caused in the Netherlands by <i>Lucilia
  sericata</i>, a Green-bottle-fly, extremely similar to our common <i>L. caesar</i>, which
  deposited its eggs in great quantities on sheep amongst their wool. This epidemic was attributed
  to the importation of sheep from England; but, according to Karsch, there is reason to suppose
  that the fly was really introduced from Southern Europe or Asia Minor.<a id="NtA_436"
  href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The larvae of species of the genus <i>Lucilia</i> sometimes attack man and animals in South
  America, but fortunately not in this country. The larva of <i>Lucilia</i> (<i>Compsomyia</i>)
  <i>macellaria</i> is called the screw-worm, and is the best known of the forms that infest man,
  the larvae living in the nasal fossae and frontal sinuses, and causing great suffering. The fly is
  common in North America, but is said never to attack man farther north than in Kansas. A little
  fly (<i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>), very like the common house-fly though rather more distinctly
  spotted with grey and black, and with a fine, hard, exserted proboscis, frequently enters our
  houses and inflicts a bite or prick on us. It is commonly mistaken for an ill-natured house-fly
  that has taken to biting. It is frequently a source of irritation to cattle. A closely allied fly,
  <i>Haematobia serrata</i>, is very injurious to cattle in North America, but the same species
  causes no serious annoyance in England. We may mention that the various attacks of Dipterous
  larvae on man have received the general name "myiasis."</p>

  <p>The Tse-tse fly (<i>Glossina morsitans</i>), another ally of <i>Stomoxys</i>, is not very
  dissimilar in size and shape to the blow-fly.<a id="NtA_437" href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a>
  <span class="pagenum" id="page513"><span class="smaller">{513}</span></span>It bites man and
  animals in South Africa, and if it have previously bitten an animal whose blood was charged with
  the Haematozoa that really constitute the disease called Nagana (fly-disease), it inoculates the
  healthy animal with the disease; fortunately only some species are susceptible, and man is not
  amongst them. It has recently been shown by Surgeon Bruce<a id="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> that this fly multiplies by producing, one at a time, a
  full-grown larva, which immediately changes to a pupa, as do the members of the series Pupipara.
  There are already known other Muscid flies with peculiarities in their modes of reproduction, so
  that it is far from impossible that the various conditions between ordinary egg-laying and
  full-grown larva- or pupa-production may be found to exist. Although it has been supposed that the
  Tse-tse fly is a formidable obstacle to the occupation of Africa by civilised men, there is reason
  to suppose that this will not ultimately prove to be the case. It only produces disease when this
  pre-exists in animals in the neighbourhood; only certain species are liable to it; and there is
  some evidence to the effect that even these may in the course of a succession of generations
  become capable of resisting the disease inoculated by the fly. As long ago as 1878 Dr. Drysdale
  suggested<a id="NtA_439" href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a> that this fly only produces disease
  by inoculating a blood-parasite, and all the evidence that has since been received tends to show
  that his idea is correct.</p>

  <p>Although the facts we have mentioned above would lead to the supposition that Muscidae are
  unmitigated nuisances, yet it is probable that such an idea is the reverse of the truth, and that
  on the whole their operations are beneficial. It would be difficult to overestimate their value as
  scavengers. And in addition to this they destroy injurious creatures. Thus in Algeria <i>Idia
  fasciata</i>, a fly like the House-fly, destroys the <span class="pagenum" id="page514"><span
  class="smaller">{514}</span></span>dreaded migratory Locust <i>Schistocerca peregrina</i> in great
  quantities, by the larvae eating the eggs of the Locust. The female of this fly, in order to reach
  the desired food, penetrates from one to three inches below the surface of the ground.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 39. Oestridae</b> (<i>Bot-flies</i>).&mdash;<i>Rather large or very large flies, with
  extremely short antennae, bearing a segmented arista, the front of the head prominent, the
  posterior part of the wings frequently rough, and with but few veins: the mouth usually atrophied,
  the trophi being represented only by tubercles; larvae living in Vertebrates, usually Mammals,
  though it is possible that a few occur in Birds and even in Reptiles.</i> This is a family of
  small extent, less than 100 species being known from all the world, yet it is of much interest on
  account of the habits of its members, which, though of large size, live entirely at the expense of
  living Vertebrates, to the viscera or other structures of which they have definite relations,
  varying according to the species. Some (<i>Gastrophilus</i>, etc.) live in the alimentary canal;
  others (<i>Hypoderma</i>, etc.) are encysted in or under the skin; while others (<i>Oestrus</i>,
  etc.) occupy the respiratory passages. As many of them attack the animals used by man, and some of
  them do not spare man himself, they have attracted much attention, and there is an extensive
  literature connected with them; nevertheless the life-histories are still very incompletely known.
  Indeed, the group is from all points of view a most difficult one, it being almost impossible to
  define the family owing to the great differences that exist in important points. Some think the
  family will ultimately be dismembered; and Girschner has recently proposed to treat it as a
  division of Tachinidae. The chief authority is Brauer, in whose writings the student will find
  nearly all that is known about Oestridae.<a id="NtA_440" href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> Some
  of them exist in considerable numbers (it is believed that they are now not so common as
  formerly), and yet the flies are but rarely met with, their habits being in many respects
  peculiar. Some of them, for purposes of repose, frequent the summits of mountains, or towers, or
  lofty trees. Some have great powers of humming; none of them are known to bite their victims,
  indeed the atrophied mouth of most of the Oestridae forbids such a proceeding.</p>

  <p>Some deposit their eggs on the hairs of the beasts from which the larvae are to draw their
  nutriment, but others place their larvae, already hatched, in the entrances of the nasal passages.
  They do not feed on the blood or tissues of their victims, but on the secretions, and these are
  generally altered or increased by the irritation induced by the presence of the unwelcome guests.
  It would appear, on the whole, that their presence is less injurious than would be expected, and
  as they always quit the bodies of their hosts for the purposes of pupation, a natural end is put
  to their attacks. We have ten species in Britain, the animals attacked being the ox, the horse,
  the ass, the sheep, and the red deer; others occasionally occur in connexion with animals in
  menageries. The eggs of <i>Gastrophilus equi</i> are placed by the fly, when on the wing, on the
  hair of horses near the front parts of the body, frequently near the knee, and, after hatching,
  the young larvae pass into the stomach of the horse either by being licked off, or by their own
  locomotion; in the stomach they become hooked to the walls, and after being full grown pass out
  with the excreta: the Bots&mdash;as these larvae are called&mdash;are sometimes very numerous in
  the stomach, for a fly will lay as many as four or five hundred eggs on a single horse: in the
  case of weakly animals, perforation of the stomach has been known to occur in consequence of the
  habit of the Bot of burying itself to a greater or less extent in the walls of the stomach.
  <i>Hypoderma bovis</i> and <i>H. lineata</i> attack the ox, and the larvae cause tumours in the
  skin along the middle part of the back. It was formerly <span class="pagenum" id="page516"><span
  class="smaller">{516}</span></span>inferred from this that the fly places its eggs in this
  situation, and as the cattle are known to dread and flee from the fly, it was supposed to be on
  account of the pain inflicted when the egg was thrust through the skin. Recent observations have
  shown that these views are erroneous, but much still remains to be ascertained. The details of
  oviposition are not yet fully known, but it appears that the eggs are laid on the lower parts of
  the body, especially near the heels, and that they hatch very speedily.<a id="NtA_441"
  href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> As the imago of <i>Hypoderma</i> appears for only a very short
  period in the summer, the time of the oviposition is certain. The newly-disclosed larva is
  considerably different from the more advanced instar found in the skin of the back; moreover, a
  long period of many months intervenes between the hatching of the larva and its appearance in the
  part mentioned. Brauer has shown that when the grub is first found in that situation it is
  entirely subcutaneous. Hence it would be inferred that the newly-hatched larva penetrated the skin
  probably near the spot it was deposited on, and passed a period in subcutaneous wandering, on the
  whole going upwards till it arrived at the uppermost part: that after moulting, and in consequence
  of greater need for air, it then pierced the skin, and brought its breathing organs into contact
  with the external air; that the irritation caused by the admission of air induced a purulent
  secretion, and caused the larva to be enclosed in a capsule. Dr. Cooper Curtice has however found,
  in the oesophagus of cattle, larvae that he considers to be quite the same as those known to be
  the young of <i>Hypoderma</i>; and if this prove to be correct, his inference that the young
  larvae are licked up by the cattle and taken into the mouth becomes probable. The larva, according
  to this view, subsequently pierces the oesophagus and becomes subcutaneous by passing through the
  intervening tissues. The later history of the grub is briefly, that when full grown it somewhat
  enlarges the external orifice of its cyst, and by contractions and expansions of the body, passes
  to the surface, falls to the ground, buries itself and becomes a pupa. If Dr. Curtice be correct,
  there should, of course, be as many, if not more, larvae found in the oesophagus as in the back of
  the animal; but, so far as is known, this is not the case, and we shall not be surprised if the
  normal course of development be found different from what Dr. Curtice supposes it to be. His <span
  class="pagenum" id="page517"><span class="smaller">{517}</span></span>observations relate to
  <i>Hypoderma lineata</i>. Our common British species is usually supposed to be <i>H. bovis</i>;
  but from recent observations it seems probable that most of the "Ox-warbles" of this country are
  really due to the larvae of <i>H. lineata</i>.</p>

  <p>The history of <i>Oestrus ovis</i>, which attacks the sheep, is also incompletely known, but
  appears to be much simpler. This fly is viviparous, and deposits its young larvae at the entrance
  of the nasal passages of the sheep, thereby causing extreme annoyance to the animal. The larvae
  penetrate to the frontal sinuses to complete their growth. The duration of their lives is unknown,
  for it is commonly the case that larvae of various sizes are found together. <i>Cephenomyia
  rufibarbis</i> has recently been found in Scotland. It attacks the Red deer, and its life-history
  is similar to that of <i>Oestrus ovis</i>, though the larvae apparently prefer to attain their
  full growth in the pharynx of the deer.</p>

  <p>In reference to the Oestridae that attack man, we may merely mention that the larva of the
  <i>Hypoderma</i> of the ox is occasionally found in Europe infesting human beings, but only as an
  extremely rare and exceptional event; and that only those engaged in attending on cattle are
  attacked; from which it is inferred that the flies are deceived by an odour emanating from the
  garments. In America numerous cases are known of Oestrid larvae being taken from the body of man,
  but information about them is very scanty. It appears, however, that there are at least four
  species, one of which, <i>Dermatobia noxialis</i>, is known as a fly as well as a larva. Whether
  any of these are peculiar to man is uncertain.<a id="NtA_442" href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a>
  There are several larvae of Muscidae that have similar habits to the Oestridae; hence the
  statements that exist as to larvae being found in birds and reptiles cannot be considered to apply
  to members of the latter family until the larvae have been studied by an expert.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The family Ctenostylidae has been established by Bigot for a South American Insect,
  of which only a single individual exists in collections. It is doubtful whether it can be referred
  to Oestridae.<a id="NtA_443" href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series V. Pupipara</b></p>

  <p>The four families included in this Series are, with the exception of the Hippoboscidae, very
  little known. Most of <span class="pagenum" id="page518"><span
  class="smaller">{518}</span></span>them live by sucking blood from Mammals and Birds, and
  sometimes they are wingless parasites. The single member of the family Braulidae lives on bees.
  The term Pupipara is erroneous, and it would be better to revert to R&eacute;aumur's prior appellation
  Nymphipara. M&uuml;ggenburg has suggested that the division is not a natural one, the points of
  resemblance that exist between its members being probably the results of convergence. Recent
  discoveries as to the modes of bringing forth of Muscidae give additional force to this
  suggestion. A satisfactory definition of the group in its present extent seems impossible.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 40. Hippoboscidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Wings very variable, sometimes present and large, then
  with waved surface and thick nervures confined to the anterior and basal part; sometimes mere
  strips, sometimes entirely absent.</i> Certain members of this family are well known, the
  Forest-fly, or Horse-fly, and the Sheep-tick belonging to it. The proboscis is of peculiar
  formation, and not like that of other flies. Seen externally it consists of two elongate, closely
  adapted, hard flaps; these are capable of diverging laterally to allow an inner tube to be
  exserted from the head. The details and morphology of the structure have recently been discussed
  by M&uuml;ggenburg.<a id="NtA_444" href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a> <i>Melophagus ovinus</i>,
  commonly called the Sheep-tick, is formed for creeping about on the skin of the sheep beneath the
  wool, and may consequently be procured with ease at the period of sheep-shearing: it has no
  resemblance to a fly, and it is difficult to persuade the uninitiated that it is such.
  <i>Hippobosca equina</i> (called in this country the Forest-fly, perhaps because it is better
  known in the New Forest than elsewhere), looks like a fly, but will be readily recognised by the
  two little cavities on the head, one close to each eye, in which the antennae are concealed, only
  the fine bristle projecting. Very little seems to be known as to the Natural History of this fly.
  <i>Lipoptena cervi</i> lives on the Red deer; the perfect Insect has apparently a long life, and
  both sexes may be found in a wingless state on the deer all through the winter. When first
  disclosed in the summer they are however provided with wings, but when they have found a suitable
  host they bite off, or cast, the wings. The female, it appears, does this more promptly than the
  male, so that it is difficult to get winged individuals of the former sex.<a id="NtA_445"

  <p>Most of the known Hippoboscidae live on birds, and are apparently specially fond of the Swallow
  tribe. They are all winged, though in some species the wings are very small. The bird-infesting
  Hippoboscidae have been very little studied, and will probably form a distinct family; the
  antennae of <i>Stenopteryx hirundinis</i> are quite different from those of <i>Hippobosca</i>. The
  development is remarkable, and has been studied by Leuckart<a id="NtA_446"
  href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> and by Pratt<a id="NtA_447"
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a> in the case of <i>Melophagus ovinus</i>. The ovaries are
  peculiarly formed, and produce one large egg at a time; this passes into the dilated oviduct, and
  there goes through its full growth and a certain amount of development; it is then extruded, and
  undergoing little or no change of form becomes externally hardened by the excretion of chitin,
  passing thus into the condition of the Eumyiid pupa. Dufour thought that there is no larval stage
  in this Insect, but it is quite clear from later researches that he was wrong, and that a larval
  stage of a peculiar kind, but in some respects resembling that of the Eumyiid Muscidae, occurs.
  The larva has no true head, but the anterior part of the body is invaginated, and the most
  anterior part again protrudes in the invagination, so that two little passages appear on section
  (Fig. 246); the upper one leads to the stomach, which is of very large size. The tracheal system
  is peculiar; it is metapneustic, there being neither anterior nor lateral spiracles. Pratt says
  that there is at first a single pair of terminal spiracles, and subsequently three pairs, hence he
  considers that the terminal part of the body corresponds to three segments. This is however
  probably a mistaken view; it appears more probable that the so-called three pairs of stigmata
  really correspond with the complex <span class="pagenum" id="page520"><span
  class="smaller">{520}</span></span>condition of the stigmata in the later instars of certain other
  Dipterous larvae. The <i>Melophagus</i>-larva is nourished by secretion from certain glands of the
  mother-fly; this is swallowed and the stomach is greatly distended by this milky fluid. Probably
  it was this condition that induced Dufour to suppose the larva to be only an embryo.</p>

  <p>Some of the Hippoboscidae that live on birds take to the wing with great readiness, and it is
  probable that these bird-parasites will prove more numerous than is at present suspected.</p>

  <p>We may here notice an animal recently described by Dr. Adensamer and called
  <i>Ascodipteron</i>.<a id="NtA_448" href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a> He treats it as the female
  imago of a Pupiparous Dipteron. It was found buried in the skin of the wing of a bat of the genus
  <i>Phyllorhina</i>, in the Dutch East Indies, only one individual being known. It is entirely
  unsegmented, and externally without head. If Dr. Adensamer should prove to be correct in his
  surmise the creature can scarcely be inferior in interest to the Strepsiptera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 41. Braulidae.</b>&mdash;This consists only of a minute Insect that lives on bees. The
  antennae are somewhat like those of the sheep-tick, though they are not so completely concealed in
  the cavities in which they are inserted. According to M&uuml;ggenburg<a id="NtA_449"
  href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> a ptilinum exists, and he is also of opinion that although the
  parts of the mouth differ very much from those of Hippoboscidae they are essentially similar.
  Lucas says that <i>Braula</i> specially affects the thorax of the bee: M&uuml;ggenburg, that it is fond
  of the queen-bee because of the exposed membranes between the body-segments that exist in that
  sex. Whether this Insect is truly Pupiparous is unknown, though Boise states that a pupa is
  deposited in the cell of the bee by the side of the young larva of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page521"><span class="smaller">{521}</span></span>the bee, and appears as the perfect Insect
  in about twenty-one days. M&uuml;ggenburg suggests that <i>Braula</i> may be oviparous, as he has never
  found a larva in the abdomen. Packard says that on the day the larva hatches from the egg it sheds
  its skin and turns to an oval puparium of a dark brown colour. The Insect is frequently though
  inappropriately called bee-louse; notwithstanding its name it is not quite blind, though the eyes
  are very imperfect.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 42. Streblidae.</b>&mdash; <i>Winged; possessing halteres; the head small, narrow and
  free.</i> These very rare Diptera are altogether problematic. According to Kolenati the larvae
  live in bats' excrement and the perfect Insects on the bats.<a id="NtA_450"
  href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> If the former statement be correct the Insects can scarcely
  prove to be Pupipara. The wing-nervuration is, in the figures of the Russian author, quite
  different from that of Hippoboscidae. The Streblidae have been associated by some entomologists
  with Nycteribiidae, and by Williston with Hippoboscidae.</p>

  from that of <i>Melophagus</i> in the arrangement of the stigmata; they appear to be dorsal

  <p>We all know that the Flea is so flat, or compressed sideways, that it does not mind the most
  severe squeeze.  This condition is almost peculiar to it; a great flattening of the body is common
  in Insects&mdash;as is seen in another annoying Insect, the bed-bug&mdash;but the compression, in
  the flea, is in the reverse direction. In other respects the external anatomy of the flea shows
  several peculiarities, the morphological import of which has not yet been elucidated. The head is
  of very peculiar shape, small, with the antennae placed in an unusual position; the clypeus is
  said to be entirely absent, the front legs are articulated in such a manner that they have a large
  additional basal piece&mdash;called by some anatomists the ischium&mdash;and in consequence appear
  to be placed far forwards, looking as if they were attached to the head; the meso- and meta-thorax
  have certain flaps that have been considered to be homologues of wings; and the maxillary palpi
  are attached to the head in such a way that they appear to play the part of the antennae of other
  Insects (Fig. 250), and were actually considered to be the antennae by Linnaeus, as well as
  others; the mouth-parts themselves are differently constructed from those of any other Insects.<a
  id="NtA_452" href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> The maxillae and labium are considered to be not
  only present, but well developed, the former possessing palpi moderately well developed, while the
  labial palps are very large and of highly peculiar form, being imperfectly transversely jointed
  and acting as sheaths; the mandibles are present in the form of a pair of elongate, slender
  organs, with serrated edges; and there is an unpaired, elongate pricking-organ, thought by some to
  be a hypopharynx, and by others a labrum.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The antennae are of unusual form, consisting of two basal joints, and, loosely connected
  therewith, a terminal mass of diverse form and more or less distinctly, though irregularly,
  segmented. The full number of ten stigmata exists, Wagner giving three thoracic, with seven
  abdominal, placed on segments 2-8 of the abdomen; but Packard thinks the supposed metathoracic
  stigma is really the first abdominal. Fleas undergo a very complete metamorphosis; the larvae are
  wormlike, resembling those of Mycetophilid Diptera (Fig. 252). The egg of the cat's flea is
  deposited among the fur of the animal, but (unlike the eggs of other parasites) apparently is not
  fastened to the hair, for the eggs fall freely to the ground from infested animals; the young
  larva when hatched bears on the head a curious structure for breaking the egg-shell. It has the
  mouth-parts of a mandibulate Insect and is peripneustic, having ten pairs of stigmata. It
  subsequently becomes of less elongate form. Flea-larvae are able to nourish themselves on almost
  any kind of refuse animal matter, Laboulb&egrave;ne having reared them on the sweepings of apartments;
  they may perhaps sometimes feed on blood; at any rate the contents of the alimentary canal appear
  red through the transparent integuments. When full grown the larva makes a cocoon, and frequently
  covers it with pieces of dust. The perfect flea appears in a week or two thereafter; the pupa has
  the members free. The food of the larvae of fleas has been much discussed and a variety of
  statements made on the subject. It has been stated that the mother-flea after being gorged with
  blood carries some of it to the young, but K&uuml;nckel has shown that there is very little foundation
  for this tale. Enormous numbers of fleas are sometimes found in uninhabited apartments to which
  animals have previously had access, and these fleas will attack in numbers and with great
  eagerness any unfortunate person who may enter <span class="pagenum" id="page525"><span
  class="smaller">{525}</span></span>the apartment. The cat-flea can pass through its growth and
  metamorphosis with excessive rapidity, the entire development of a generation in favourable
  conditions extending but little beyond a fortnight.<a id="NtA_453"
  href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a></p>

  <p>About a hundred kinds of fleas are known, all of which live on mammals or birds.
  <i>Hystrichopsylla talpae</i> (Fig. 250) is one of the largest, it occurs on the Mole. It was
  found by Ritsema in the nests of <i>Bombus subterraneus</i> (and was described under the name of
  <i>Pulex obtusiceps</i>). As these nests are known to be harried by Voles, and as this flea has
  also been found on Field-mice, it is probable that the parasites are carried to the nests by the
  Voles. The species that chiefly infests man is <i>Pulex irritans</i>, an Insect that is nearly
  cosmopolitan, though arid desert regions are apparently unsuitable to it. <i>Pulex avium</i>
  occurs on a great variety of birds. <i>P. serraticeps</i> infests the dog and the cat, as well as
  a variety of other Mammals. It is a common opinion that each species of Mammal has its own
  peculiar flea, but this is far from correct. Fleas pass readily from one species of animal to
  another; the writer formerly possessed a cat that was a most determined and successful hunter of
  rabbits, and she frequently returned from her excursions swarming with fleas that she had become
  infested with when in the rabbits' burrows; her ears were on some occasions very sore from the
  flea-bites. Some of the fleas of other animals undoubtedly bite man. There appears, however, to be
  much difference in the liability of different individuals of our own species to the bites of
  fleas. <i>Sarcopsylla penetrans</i> differs in habits from other fleas, as the female buries the
  anterior parts of her body in the flesh of man or other Vertebrates, and the abdomen then becomes
  enormously enlarged and distended and undergoes a series of changes that are of much interest.<a
  id="NtA_454" href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> While in this position the Insect discharges a
  number of eggs. This species multiplies sufficiently to become a serious pest in certain regions,
  the body of one man having been known to be affording hospitality to 300 of these fleas.
  <i>Sarcopsylla penetrans</i> is known as the Sand-flea, or chigger, and by numerous other names.
  Originally a native of tropical America it has been carried to other parts of the world. Another
  <i>Sarcopsylla</i>, <i>S. gallinacea</i>, attaches itself to the eyelids <span class="pagenum"
  id="page526"><span class="smaller">{526}</span></span>of the domestic fowl in Ceylon, and an
  allied form, <i>Rhynchopsylla pulex</i>, fastens itself to the eyelids and other parts of the body
  of birds and bats in South America. In Turkestan <i>Vermipsylla alakurt</i> attacks
  cattle&mdash;ox, horse, camel, sheep&mdash;fastening itself to the body of the animal after the
  fashion of a tick. Retaining this position all through the winter, it becomes distended somewhat
  after the manner of the Sand-flea, though it never forms a spherical body. The parts of the mouth
  in this Insect (Fig. 251) are unusually long, correlative with the thickness of the skins of the
  animals on which it lives. Grassi considers that the dog's flea, <i>Pulex serraticeps</i>, acts as
  the intermediate host of Taenia.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Great difference of opinion has for long prevailed as to whether fleas should be
  treated as a Sub-Order of Diptera or as a separate Order of Insects. Wagner and K&uuml;nckel, who have
  recently discussed the question, think they may pass as aberrant Diptera, while Packard,<a
  id="NtA_455" href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> the last writer on the subject, prefers to
  consider them a separate Order more closely allied to Diptera than to any other Insects. Although
  widely known as Aphaniptera, several writers call them Siphonaptera, because Latreille proposed
  that name for them some years before Kirby called them Aphaniptera. Meinert considers them a
  separate Order and calls it Suctoria, a most unfortunate name.</p>

  flowers. Their size is only from <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">50</span> to
  &#x2153; of an inch in length; those of the latter magnitude are in fact giant species, and so far

  class="pagenum" id="page527"><span class="smaller">{527}</span></span>of the Order it would appear
  that Thysanoptera are insignificant, as less than 150 species are known. Thrips have been,
  however, very much neglected by entomologists, so it will not be a matter for surprise if there
  should prove to be several thousand species. These Insects present several points of interest;
  their mouth-organs are unique in structure; besides this, they exhibit so many points of
  dissimilarity from other Insects that it is impossible to treat them as subdivisions of any other
  Order. They have, however, been considered by some to be aberrant Pseudoneuroptera (cf. Vol. V.),
  while others have associated them with Hemiptera. Both Brauer and Packard have treated
  Thysanoptera as a separate Order, and there can be no doubt that this is correct. Thysanoptera
  have recently been monographed by Uzel in a work that is, unfortunately for most of us, in the
  Bohemian language.<a id="NtA_456" href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The antennae are never very long, and are 6 to 9-jointed. The head varies much, being sometimes
  elongate and tubular, but sometimes short; it has, however, always the peculiarity that the
  antennae are placed quite on its front part, and that the mouth appears to be absent, owing to its
  parts being thrust against the under side of the thorax and concealed. Their most remarkable
  peculiarity is that some of them are asymmetrical: Uzel looks on the peculiar structure, the
  "Mundstachel," <i>m</i>, <i>m</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page528"><span
  class="smaller">{528}</span></span>(Fig. 254) found on the left side of the body, as probably an
  enormous development of the epipharynx. Previous to the appearance of Uzel's work, Garman had,
  however, correctly described the structure of the mouth;<a id="NtA_457"
  href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> he puts a different interpretation on the parts; he points out
  that the mandibles (<i>j</i>), so-called by Uzel, are attached to the maxillae, and he considers
  that they are really jointed, and that they are lobes thereof; while the Mundstachel or piercer
  is, he considers, the left mandible; the corresponding structure of the other side being nearly
  entirely absent. He points out that the labrum and endocranium are also asymmetrical. We think
  Garman's view a reasonable one, and may remark that dissimilarity of the mandibles of the two
  sides is usual in Insects, and that the mandibles may be hollow for sucking, as is shown by the
  larvae of Hemerobiides. There are usually three ocelli, but they are absent in the entirely
  apterous forms.</p>

  <p>The wings appear to spring from the dorsal surface of the body, not from the sides; the
  anterior pair is always quite separated from the posterior; the wings are always slender,
  sometimes very slender; in other respects they exhibit considerable variety; sometimes the front
  pair are different in colour and consistence from the other pair. The abdomen has ten segments,
  the last of which is often tubular in form. The peculiar vesicular structures by which the feet
  are terminated are, during movement, alternately distended and emptied, and have two hooks or
  claws on the sides. The stigmata are extremely peculiar, there being four pairs, the first being
  the mesothoracic, 2nd <span class="pagenum" id="page529"><span
  class="smaller">{529}</span></span>metathoracic, 3rd on the second abdominal segment, 4th on the
  eighth abdominal segment.<a id="NtA_458" href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> There are four
  Malpighian tubes, and two or three pairs of salivary glands. The dorsal vessel is said to be a
  short sack placed in the 7th and 8th abdominal segments. The abdominal ganglia of the ventral
  chain are concentrated in a single mass, placed in, or close to, the thorax; the thorax has two
  other approximated ganglia, as well as an anterior one that appears to be the
  infra-oesophageal.</p>

  <p>The metamorphosis is also peculiar; the larva does not differ greatly in appearance from the
  adult, and has similar mouth-organs and food-habits. The wings are developed outside the body at
  the sides, and appear first, according to Heeger, after the third moult. The nymph-condition is
  like that of a pupa inasmuch as no nourishment is taken, and the parts of the body are enclosed in
  a skin: in some species there is power of movement to a slight degree, but other species are quite
  motionless. In some cases the body is entirely bright red, though subsequently there is no trace
  of this colour. Jordan distinguishes two nymphal periods, the first of which he calls the
  pronymphal; in it the Insect appears to be in a condition intermediate between that of the larva
  and that of the true nymph; the old cuticle being retained, though the hypodermis is detached from
  it and forms a fresh cuticle beneath it. This condition, as Jordan remarks, seems parallel to that
  of the male Coccid, and approaches closely to complete metamorphosis; indeed the only characters
  by which the two can be distinguished appear to be (1) that the young has not a special form; (2)
  that the wings are developed outside the body.</p>

  <p>Thrips take their food, it is believed, in the same manner as Aphidae, by suction; but the
  details of the process are not by any means certain, and examination of the stomach is said to
  have resulted in finding pollen therein. Walsh thought that Thysanoptera pierce and suck Aphidae.
  An elaborate inquiry by Osborn<a id="NtA_459" href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> failed to elicit
  satisfactory confirmation of Walsh's idea, though Riley and Pergande support it to some extent;
  Osborn concludes that the ordinary food is not drawn directly from sap, but consists of exudation
  or pollen, the tissues <span class="pagenum" id="page530"><span
  class="smaller">{530}</span></span>of the plant being pierced only when a supply of food from the
  usual sources falls short. Members of this family have been reputed as being very injurious to
  cultivated plants, especially to cereals, and it is said that as a result the harvests in Europe
  have been seriously diminished. Several species may take part in the attacks. These appear to be
  directed chiefly against the inflorescence. Lindeman thought that <i>Limothrips denticornis</i> (=
  <i>Thrips secalina</i>), and <i>Anthothrips aculeata</i> (= <i>Phloeothrips frumentarius</i>),
  were the most destructive species in an attack of Thrips on corn that he investigated in Russia.
  Uzel suggests that injuries due to other causes are sometimes ascribed to Thrips.<a id="NtA_460"
  href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> In hot-houses these Insects are well known, and sometimes
  occasion considerable damage to foliage. The German horticulturalists call them black-fly, in
  distinction from Aphidae or green-fly. Some Thysanoptera live under bark, and even in fungi, and
  in Australia they form galls on the leaves of trees. This observation is due to Mr Froggatt, and
  is confirmed by specimens he sent to the writer. Vesicular bodies in the leaves of <i>Acacia
  saligna</i> were traversed on one side by a longitudinal slit, and on a section being made,
  nothing but Thrips, in various stages of growth, was found inside them. A second kind of gall,
  forming masses of considerable size on the twigs of <i>Callistemon</i>, is said by Mr Froggatt to
  be also due to Thrips, as is a third kind on <i>Bursaria spinosa</i>. It is curious that Thrips'
  galls have not been observed in other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>Thysanoptera are devoured by small bugs of the genus <i>Triphleps</i>, as well as by beetles; a
  small Acarid attacks them by fixing itself to the body of the Thrips. Nematode worms and their
  eggs were found by Uzel in the body-cavity. He found no less than 200 Nematodes in one Thrips, and
  noticed that they had entirely destroyed the ovaries. Woodpeckers, according to him, tear off the
  bark of trees and eat the Thysanoptera that are concealed thereunder, though one would have
  surmised that these minute Insects are too small to be game for such birds. They have, it appears,
  no special protection, except that one species (a larva of <i>Phloeothrips</i> sp.) is said to
  emit a protective fluid.</p>

  <p>Parthenogenesis seems to be frequent amongst Thysanoptera, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page531"><span class="smaller">{531}</span></span>and is found in concurrence with diversity
  as to winged and wingless females of the same species, so as to have given rise to the idea that
  the phenomena in this respect are parallel with those that are more widely known as occurring in
  Aphidae. Under certain circumstances few or no males are produced (one of the circumstances,
  according to Jordan, being season of the year), and the females continue the species
  parthenogenetically. In other cases, though males are produced they are in very small numbers.
  Some species of Thysanoptera are never winged; in others the individuals are winged or wingless
  according to sex. But there are other cases in which the female is usually wingless, and is
  exceptionally winged. The winged specimens in this case are, it is thought, of special use in
  disseminating the species. Jordan has suggested that these phenomena may be of a regular nature,
  but Uzel does not take this view. Another condition may be mentioned, in which the species is
  usually wingless, but winged individuals of the male as well as of the female sex occasionally
  appear. <i>Thrips lini</i> apparently makes regular migrations, feeding at one time underground on
  the roots of flax, and then changing to a life in the open air on other plants.</p>

  <p>Numerous forms of Thysanoptera, belonging to both of the great divisions of the Order, have
  been found fossil in Europe and North America, but all are confined to deposits of the Tertiary
  epoch.</p>

  <p>Of the 135 species known to Uzel, 117 are European; they are divided into two Sub-Orders. 1,
  Terebrantia, in which the females are provided with an external toothed ovipositor, of two valves;
  2, Tubulifera, in which there is no ovipositor, and the extremity of the body is tubular in both
  sexes. The British species are about 50 in number, and were described by Haliday about 60 years
  ago;<a id="NtA_461" href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a> of late they have been very little
  studied.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The name Physopoda or Physapoda is used for this Order, instead of Thysanoptera, by
  several naturalists.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Hemiptera or Bugs are perhaps more widely known as Rhynchota. In deciding whether an Insect
  belongs to this Order the student will do well to examine in the first place the beak, treating
  the wings as subordinate in importance, their condition being much more variable than that of the
  beak. The above definition includes no reference to the degraded Anoplura or Lice. These are
  separately dealt with on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page599">599</a></span>; they are
  absolutely wingless, and have an unjointed proboscis not placed beneath the body, the greater part
  of it being usually withdrawn inside the body of the Insect.</p>

  <p>The Hemiptera are without exception sucking Insects, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page533"><span class="smaller">{533}</span></span>the mouth-organs of the individual are of
  one form throughout its life. In this latter fact, coupled with another, that the young are not
  definitely different in form from the adult, Bugs differ widely from all other Insects with
  sucking-mouth. They agree with the Orthoptera in the facts that the mouth does not change its
  structure during the individual life, and that the development of the individual is gradual, its
  form, as a rule, changing but little. In respect of the structure of the mouth, Orthoptera and
  Hemiptera are the most different of all the Orders. Hence, Hemiptera is really the most isolated
  of all the Orders of Insects. We shall subsequently see that, like Orthoptera, the Order appeared
  in the Palaeozoic epoch. Although a very extensive Order, Hemiptera have for some incomprehensible
  reason never been favourite objects of study. Sixty years ago Dufour pointed out that they were
  the most neglected of all the great Orders of Insects, and this is still true; our acquaintance
  with their life-histories and morphology especially being very limited.</p>

  <p>There is probably no Order of Insects that is so directly connected with the welfare of the
  human race as the Hemiptera; indeed, if anything were to exterminate the enemies of Hemiptera, we
  ourselves should probably be starved in the course of a few months. The operations of Hemiptera,
  however, to a large extent escape observation, as their mouth-setae make merely pricks that do not
  attract notice in plants; hence, it is probable that <span class="pagenum" id="page534"><span
  class="smaller">{534}</span></span>injuries really due to Hemiptera are frequently attributed to
  other causes.</p>

  <p>In the course of the following brief sketch of the anatomy and development of Hemiptera, we
  shall frequently have to use the terms Heteroptera and Homoptera; we may therefore here mention
  that there are two great divisions of Hemiptera having but little connection, and known by the
  above names: the members of these two Sub-Orders may in most cases be distinguished by the
  condition of the wings, as mentioned in the definition at the commencement of this chapter.</p>

  <p><b>External structure.</b>&mdash;The mouth-parts consist of an anterior or upper and a
  posterior or lower enwrapping part, and of the organs proper, which are four hair-like bodies,
  dilated at their bases and resting on a complex chitinous framework. The lower part forms by far
  the larger portion of the sheath and is of very diverse lengths, and from one to four-jointed: it
  is as it were an enwrapping organ, and a groove may be seen running along it, in addition to the
  evident cross-segmentation. The upper covering part is much smaller, and only fills a gap at the
  base of the sheath; it can readily be lifted so as to disclose the setae; these latter organs are
  fine, flexible, closely connected, rods, four in number, though often seeming to be only three,
  owing to the intimate union of the components of one of the two pairs; at their base the setae
  become broader, and are closely connected with some of the loops of the chitinous framework that
  is contained within the head. Sometimes the setae are much longer than the sheath; they are
  capable of protrusion. Although varying considerably in minor points, such as the lengths of the
  sheath and setae, and the number of cross-joints of the sheath, these structures are so far as is
  known constant throughout the Order. There are no palpi, and the only additions exceptionally
  present are a pair of small plates that in certain forms (aquatic family Belostomidae) lie on the
  front of the proboscis near the tip, overlapping, in fact, the last of the
  cross-articulations.</p>

  <p>Simple as is this system of trophi its morphology is uncertain, and has given rise to much
  difference of interpretation. It may be granted that the two portions of the sheath are
  respectively upper lip, and labium; but as to the other parts wide difference of opinion still
  prevails. On the whole the view most generally accepted, to the effect that the inner pair of the
  setae correspond <span class="pagenum" id="page535"><span class="smaller">{535}</span></span>in a
  broad sense with maxillae of mandibulate Insects, and the outer pair with mandibles, is probably
  correct. Mecznikow, who studied the embryology,<a id="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a>
  supports this view for Heteroptera, but he says (<i>t.c.</i> p. 462), that in Homoptera the parts
  of the embryo corresponding with rudimentary maxillae and mandibles disappear, and that the setae
  are subsequently produced from peculiar special bodies that are at first of a retort-shaped form;
  the neck of the retort becoming afterwards more elongate to form the seta; also that in the
  Heteropterous genus <i>Gerris</i> the embryology in general resembles that of Homoptera, but the
  development of the setae is like that of other Heteroptera (<i>t.c.</i> p. 478). This
  discontinuity in the development of the Homopterous mouth has since been refuted by Witlaczil,<a
  id="NtA_463" href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> who found that the retort-shaped bodies really
  arise from the primary segmental appendages after they have sunk into the head. We are therefore
  justified in concluding that the mouth-parts are at first similarly developed in all Hemiptera,
  and that this development is of a very peculiar nature.</p>

  <p>Smith is convinced that there are no traces of mandibular structure in any Hemiptera.<a
  id="NtA_464" href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a> On the other hand, numerous entomologists have
  supposed they could homologise satisfactorily various parts of the Hemipterous trophi with special
  parts of the <span class="pagenum" id="page536"><span class="smaller">{536}</span></span>maxillae
  and labium of mandibulate Insects. This point has recently been discussed by Marlatt<a
  id="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> and by Heymons.<a id="NtA_466"
  href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> From the latter we gather that the mode of growth is peculiar
  by the extension backwards of some of the sclerites, and their becoming confounded with parts of
  the wall of the head. From all this it appears that at present we cannot correctly go farther than
  saying that the trophi of Hemiptera are the appendages of three head-segments, like those of other
  Insects. The views of Savigny, L&eacute;on,<a id="NtA_467" href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> and others
  to the effect that labial palpi, and even other parts of the labium of Mandibulata can be
  satisfactorily identified are not confirmed by Heymons.</p>

  <p>Underneath the pharynx, in the head, there is a peculiar structure for which we have as yet no
  English term. It was apparently discovered by Landois and Paul Mayer,<a id="NtA_468"
  href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a> and has been called "Wanzenspritze," which we translate as
  syringe. It may be briefly described as a chamber, into which the salivary ducts open, prolonged
  in front to the neighbourhood of the grooves of the setae in the rostrum; behind, it is connected
  with muscles; it has no direct connection with the pharynx, and though it was formerly supposed to
  be an organ of suction, it seems more probable that it is of the nature of a force-pump, to propel
  the products of some of the bug's glands towards the tips of the setae.</p>

  <p>The rostrum being extended from its position of repose, the tip of the sheath is brought into
  contact with the object to be pierced, the surface of which is probably examined by means of
  sensitive hairs at the extremity of the sheath; these therefore functionally replace to some
  extent the palpi of other Insects. As a rule the sheath does not penetrate (though there is reason
  for believing that in various of the animal-feeding bugs it does so), but the setae are brought
  into action for piercing the skin of the plant; they are extremely sharp, and the outer pair are
  usually barbed, so that when once introduced a hold is easily maintained. This being established
  it is thought that the salivary pump comes into play, and that a fluid is injected into the object
  pierced so as to give rise to irritation or congestion, and thus keep up a supply of fluid at the
  point operated on: this fluid extends along the grooved setae by capillary attraction, and the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page537"><span class="smaller">{537}</span></span>rapidity of the
  current is increased by a pumping action of the pharynx, and possibly by movements of the setae
  themselves. Though the setae are often extremely elongate&mdash;sometimes several times the length
  of the body&mdash;they are nearly always slender, and there is no reason to suppose that a
  perfect, or air-tight, tube is formed; hence it is probable that capillary attraction is really
  the chief agent in the ingestion of the fluid. The slight diversity of structure of the
  Hemipterous trophi is in very striking contrast with what we find in mandibulate Insects, and in
  the less purely suctorial Insects, such as Diptera and some divisions of Hymenoptera. Schi&ouml;dte in
  commenting on this has suggested that it is probably due to the small variety of actions the
  rostrum is put to.<a id="NtA_469" href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The head exhibits great variety of form; in the Homoptera the front part is deflexed and
  inflexed, so that it is placed on the under surface, and its anterior margin is directed
  backwards; it is often peculiarly inflated; in the Lantern-flies or Fulgoridae (Fig. 282) to an
  incomprehensible extent. In the great Water-bugs, Belostomidae, there is on the under surface a
  deep pocket for each antenna, beautifully adapted to the shape of the curiously-formed appendage
  (Fig. 279). The prothorax is always very distinct, frequently large, and in many of the
  Heteroptera (Fig. 257), as well as in the Homopterous family, Membracidae (Fig. 283), assumes the
  most extraordinary shapes. Both meso- and meta-thorax are well developed. The former is remarkable
  for the great size of the scutellum; in some cases (Plataspides, Scutellerides) this forms a large
  process, <span class="pagenum" id="page538"><span class="smaller">{538}</span></span>that entirely
  covers and conceals the alar organs, so that the Insect has all the appearance of being apterous.
  The exact composition of the abdomen has not been satisfactorily determined, opinions varying as
  to whether the segments are nine, ten, or eleven in number. The difficulty of determining the
  point is due to two facts: viz. the extreme modification of the terminal segments in connection
  with the genital appendages, and the prominence of the extremity of the alimentary canal. If this
  terminal projection is to be treated as a segment, it would appear that eleven segments exist, at
  any rate in some cases; as the writer has counted ten distinct segments in a young Coreid bug, in
  addition to the terminal tube. This tube in some of the male Heteroptera is very subject to
  curious modifications, and has been called the rectal cauda. Verhoeff considers that ten segments
  were invariably present in the females examined by him in various families of Heteroptera and
  Homoptera.<a id="NtA_470" href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> In Aphidae (a division of
  Homoptera), Balbiani considers there are eleven abdominal segments present; but he treats as a
  segment a projection, called the cauda, situate over the anus; this structure does not appear to
  be homologous with the rectal cauda we have just mentioned. In Coccidae the number of abdominal
  segments is apparently reduced. Schi&ouml;dte states<a id="NtA_471" href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a>
  that the older authorities are correct in respect of the stigmata; there are, he says, in
  Heteroptera invariably ten pairs; one for each thoracic segment; and seven abdominal, placed on
  the ventral face of the pleural fold of the abdomen. In some cases there are additional orifices
  on the external surface that have been taken for stigmata, though they are really orifices of
  odoriferous glands; these openings may exist on the metasterna or on the dorsal surface of the
  abdomen. The lateral margins of the abdomen are frequently greatly developed in Heteroptera, and
  are called "connexivum;" the upper and lower surfaces of the body meeting together far within the
  marginal outline. Dr Anton Dohrn many years ago<a id="NtA_472" href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a>
  called attention to the extremely remarkable structure of the terminal segments in many male
  Hemiptera; and the subject has been subsequently very imperfectly treated by the present writer
  and other entomologists, but it has never received the attention it deserves.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page539"><span class="smaller">{539}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the females of numerous Heteroptera and Homoptera (Capsidae, Cicadidae, etc.) there is a
  well-developed ovipositor, that serves both as a cutting instrument to make slits in the stems of
  plants, and as a director to introduce the eggs therein. Verhoeff considers that it always
  consists of two pairs of processes (though one pair may be very small), one from the eighth
  abdominal segment, the other from the ninth.<a id="NtA_473"
  href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The antennae usually have very few joints, often as few as four or five, their maximum number
  of about twenty-five being attained in the males of some Coccidae, this condition being, however,
  present in but few of even this family. In <i>Belostoma</i> (Fig. 279) they assume extremely
  curious forms, analogous to what we find in the Coleopterous genus <i>Hydrophilus</i>. In addition
  to the compound eyes, there are usually ocelli, either two or three in number, but wanting in many
  cases. The usual number of joints of the tarsi is three, but in Coccidae there is only one
  joint.</p>

  posterior; they are called elytra, hemi-elytra or tegmina. This difference in the two pairs is the
  rule in the first of the great divisions of the Order, and the name Heteroptera is derived from
  the fact. In this Sub-Order the front wings close over the back, and are more or less horny, the
  apical part being, however, membranous. Systematists make use of the wings for the purpose of
  classification in Heteroptera, and distinguish the following parts, "clavus," "corium,"
  "membrane," the corium being the larger horny division, the clavus the part lying next the
  scutellum and frequently very sharply distinguished from the corium; the membrane is the apical
  part. The outer or costal part of the wing is also often sharply delimited, and is called the
  "embolium;" in the great family Capsidae and a few others, the outer apical part of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page540"><span class="smaller">{540}</span></span>corium is differentiated
  from the rest of the surface, and is termed the "cuneus." In Plataspides, one of the divisions in
  which the alar organs are entirely covered by the scutellum, they are modified in a very
  remarkable manner. In the Homoptera the divisions named above do not exist, and the wings in
  repose are placed in a different position, as stated in our definition of the Order. It is said to
  be very difficult to homologise the wing-nervures of Hemiptera, and nothing appears to be known as
  to the mode of their development.</p>

  <p>The alar organs in Hemiptera exhibit a very frequent form of variation within the limits of the
  same species; this has not yet been elucidated.<a id="NtA_474" href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a>
  In some cases in the Heteroptera nearly all the individuals of a generation may have the wings
  aborted; sometimes this occurs as a local variation. In Aphidae the occurrence of winged and
  wingless individuals is very common, and has even become an important factor in their
  extraordinary life cycles. (See <i>Chermes</i>, etc., subsequently.)</p>

  <p><b>Internal anatomy.</b>&mdash;The alimentary canal presents considerable diversity and some
  remarkable features. There is a slender tube-like oesophagus and a large crop. It is difficult to
  assign any of the parts posterior to this to the divisions usual in other Insects, and it is said
  that the distinction of parts histologically is as vague as it is anatomically. In the Heteroptera
  the Malpighian tubes open into two (or one) vesicular dilatations seated immediately in front of
  the short rectum: between this point and the crop there may be a very elongate, slender portion
  with one or more dilatations, these parts apparently replacing the true or chylific stomach. There
  is no gizzard. In the Homoptera the relations of the divisions of the alimentary canal are even
  more puzzling; the canal is elongated and forms coils, and these are connected with tissues and
  tunics so as to make their dissection extremely difficult. List says that there are great
  differences in the alimentary canal among the members of the one family Coccidae. There are
  usually four Malpighian tubes, but in Coccidae there is only one pair, and in Aphidae none. The
  excretory cells of these tubes are in Hemiptera of remarkably large size. There is a large
  development of salivary glands, at least two pairs existing. There can be little doubt that some
  of their products are used for purposes of injection, as <span class="pagenum" id="page541"><span
  class="smaller">{541}</span></span>already described, though K&uuml;nckel came to the conclusion that
  the saliva when placed in living plants is totally innocuous.<a id="NtA_475"
  href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The ganglia of the nervous system are all concentrated in the thorax and head. In some cases
  (in various Homoptera) the infra-oesophageal ganglion is placed at a distance from the
  supra-oesophageal ganglion, and may even be united with the thoracic mass of ganglia
  (<i>Orthezia</i>, etc.); in this case the chitinous framework of the mouth-parts is interposed
  between the supra- and the infra-oesophageal ganglia. In <i>Pentatoma</i> all the three ganglionic
  masses are brought into close proximity, but in <i>Nepa</i> the thoracic mass of ganglia and the
  infra-oesophageal ganglion are widely separated.</p>

  <p>The ovarian tubes vary greatly in number: according to List in <i>Orthezia cataphracta</i> the
  number differs considerably in different individuals, and even in the two ovaries of the same
  individual, the number being usually two. The testes are not placed in a common tunic, though they
  are frequently approximated or even contiguous.<a id="NtA_476"
  href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The smell of bugs is notorious. In many species it is not unpleasant, though as a rule it is
  decidedly offensive. It is a remarkable fact that the structures connected with the production of
  this odour are different in many cases in the young and in the adult. The odour emitted by the
  latter proceeds from a sac seated at the base of the abdomen, and opening exteriorly by means of
  an orifice on each side of the metasternum; while in the young there are two glands situated more
  dorsally and a little more backwards, and opening on two of the dorsal plates of the abdomen (Fig.
  255, A).<a id="NtA_477" href="#Nt_477"><sup>[477]</sup></a> In the young the dorsum of the
  abdomen, where the stink-glands open, is exposed, but this part in the adult is covered by the
  wings. The odorific apparatus is specially characteristic of Heteroptera, and K&uuml;nckel states that
  there is so much variety that generic and even specific characters might be drawn from conditions
  of the stink-glands. As a rule they are most constantly present in the plant-feeding forms; in
  some essentially carnivorous forms (Reduviidae, Nepidae, <span class="pagenum" id="page542"><span
  class="smaller">{542}</span></span>Notonectidae) they are entirely absent. The offensive matter
  emitted by <i>Notonecta</i> is of a different nature, and is probably anal in origin.</p>

  <p><b>Metamorphosis or postembryonic development.</b>&mdash;In the language of the systematists of
  metamorphosis, Hemiptera are said to be Homomorpha Paurometabola&mdash;that is, the young differ
  but little from the adult. According to Brauer's generalisations they are Menorhynchous,
  Oligonephrous, Pterygogenea, <i>i.e.</i> they have a sucking mouth that does not change during
  life, few Malpighian tubes, and are winged in the adult state. It is generally admitted that the
  Homoptera do not completely agree with Heteroptera in respect of the metamorphosis, it being more
  marked in the former, and in Coccidae attaining (as we shall mention when discussing that family)
  nearly if not quite the condition of complete metamorphosis of a peculiar kind. Unfortunately we
  are in almost complete ignorance as to the details of the life-histories and development of
  Heteroptera, so that we can form no generalised opinion as to what the post-embryonic development
  really is in them, but there are grounds for supposing that considerable changes take place, and
  that these are chiefly concentrated on the last ecdysis. The young of some bugs bear but little
  resemblance to the adult; the magnificently-coloured species of <i>Eusthenes</i> (Fig. 255),
  before they attain the adult condition are flat, colourless objects, almost as thin as a
  playing-card; it is well known that the extraordinary structures that cover and conceal the body
  in Plataspides, Scutellerides, Membracides, etc., are developed almost entirely at the last moult:
  it is not so well known that some of these changes occur with much rapidity. A very interesting
  account of the processes of colour-change, as occurring in <i>Poecilocapsus lineatus</i> at the
  last ecdysis, has been given by Lintner,<a id="NtA_478" href="#Nt_478"><sup>[478]</sup></a> and
  from this it appears that the characteristic coloration of the imago is entirely developed in the
  course of about two hours, forming a parallel in this respect with Odonata. When we come to deal
  with Aphidae we shall describe the most complex examples of cycles of generations that exist in
  the whole of the animal kingdom.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Hemiptera.</b>&mdash;Hemiptera are believed to have existed in the Palaeozoic epoch,
  but the fossils are not numerous, and opinions differ concerning them. <i>Eugereon hockingi</i>, a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page543"><span class="smaller">{543}</span></span>Permian fossil, was
  formerly supposed to be a Homopterous Insect, but it is very anomalous, and its claim to a
  position in Hemiptera is denied by Brauer,<a id="NtA_479" href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> who
  considers it to be Orthopterous. It is now generally recognised that this fossil requires complete
  reconsideration. Another Permian fossil, <i>Fulgorina</i>, is admitted to be Homopterous by
  Scudder, Brauer and Brongniart. Scudder thinks the Carboniferous <i>Phthanocoris</i> was an
  Archaic Heteropterous Insect, and if correct this would demonstrate that both of the two great
  Sub-Orders of Hemiptera existed in Palaeozoic times. Brauer, however, is inclined to refer this
  fossil to Homoptera, and Brongniart<a id="NtA_480" href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a> speaks of
  it as being without doubt a Fulgorid. <i>Dictyocicada</i>, <i>Rhipidioptera</i> and
  <i>Meganostoma</i>, from the Carboniferous shales of Commentry, have also been referred to
  Fulgoridae by Brongniart, but the evidence of their alliance with this group is far from
  satisfactory. In the Secondary epoch numerous Hemiptera existed, and are referred to several of
  the existing families. They come chiefly from the Oolite. In the Eocene of the Isle of Wight a
  fossil has been discovered that is referred to the existing Homopterous genus
  <i>Triecphora</i>.</p>

  <p>We are not entitled to conclude more from these facts than that Homoptera probably appeared
  before Heteroptera, and date back as far as the Carboniferous epoch.</p>

  <p><b>Classification and families.</b>&mdash;No complete catalogue of Hemiptera exists, but one by
  M. Severin is in course of publication. It is probable that there are about 18,000 species at
  present described, two-thirds of this number being Heteroptera. In Britain we have about 430
  species of Heteroptera and 600 of Homoptera. The classification of the Order is not in a very
  advanced condition. The following table exhibits the views of Schi&ouml;dte<a id="NtA_481"

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Pentatomidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Scutellum very large, at least half as long as the
  abdomen, often covering the whole of the after-body and alar appendages. Antennae often
  five-jointed. Proboscis-sheath four-jointed. Ocelli two. Each tarsal claw with an
  appendage.</i>&mdash;This, the largest and most important family of the Heteroptera, includes
  upwards of 4000 species, and an immense variety of forms. It is divided into no less than fourteen
  sub-families. The species of one of these, Plataspides, are remarkable for their short, broad
  forms, and the peculiar condition of the alar organs, which are so completely concealed by the
  great scutellum that it is difficult to believe the Insects are not entirely apterous. The head is
  usually inconspicuous though broad, but in a few forms it is armed with horns. Though this
  sub-family includes upwards of 200 species, and is very widely distributed in the Old World, it
  has no representatives in America. The Scutellerides also have the body covered by the scutellum,
  but their organs of flight are less peculiar than they are in the Plataspides; the Insects of this
  sub-family are highly remarkable on account of their varied and frequently vivid coloration; some
  of them are metallic, and the colour of their integuments differs greatly in some cases, according
  to whether the specimen is wet or dry; hence the appearance after death is often very different
  from that of the living specimen. These Insects are extremely numerous in species. The sub-family
  Phloeides (Fig. 259), on the contrary, includes only three or four South American species: they
  have no resemblance at all to other Pentatomidae; they are flat, about an inch long, and look like
  scales of bark, in this respect agreeing with <i>Ledra</i> and some other Homoptera. The South
  American sub-family Cyrtocorides (Fig. 260) is of <span class="pagenum" id="page546"><span
  class="smaller">{546}</span></span>equally small extent; the species are of strange irregular
  shapes, for which we can find no reason. The Tessaratomides includes many of the largest
  Hemiptera-Heteroptera, some of its members attaining two inches in length.</p>

  <p>The great family Pentatomidae, containing about 400 species, is represented in Britain by about
  36 native species, the most interesting of which are perhaps those of the genus
  <i>Acanthosoma</i>. De Geer noticed long ago that the female of <i>A. griseum</i> exhibits great
  solicitude for its young, and his statement has since been confirmed by Mr. Parfitt and the Rev.
  J. Hellins, who found that the mother not only protects the eggs but also the young, and that for
  a considerable time after hatching.<a id="NtA_484" href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Very little is known as to the life-histories of Pentatomidae. In some cases the young are very
  different in appearance from the adults. The peculiar great scutellum is not developed till the
  mature condition is reached. But little attention has been given to the habits of Pentatomidae; it
  is generally considered that they draw their nutriment from plants; the American <i>Euthyrhynchus
  floridanus</i> has, however, been noticed to suck the honey-bee, and we think it probable that a
  good many Pentatomids will be found to attack Insects.</p>

  <p>The term Pentatomidae as applied to this family is of modern origin: in most books the
  equivalent group is called Scutata, or Scutati, and the term Pentatomidae is restricted in these
  works to the sub-family called Pentatomides in the system we adopt.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Coreidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Scutellum not reaching to the middle of the body;
  proboscis-sheath four-jointed; ocelli present; antennae generally elongate and four-jointed,
  inserted on the upper parts of the sides of the head; femora not knobbed at the tip.</i>&mdash;The
  members of this great family are easily recognised by the above characters; formerly it was called
  Supericornia in connection with the characteristic position of the antennae. About 1500 species
  are known, and they are arranged in no less than twenty-nine sub-families. Many of them are
  Insects of large size, and they frequently have a conspicuous disc, or dilatation, on one of the
  joints of the antennae.</p>

  <p>Another very curious and, as yet, inexplicable peculiarity very commonly met with among them,
  is that the hind legs may be of great size and deformed; either the femora or the tibiae, or both,
  being very much distorted or armed with projections. Brilliant colour is here comparatively rare,
  the general tone being indefinite tints of browns, greys, or smoky colours. The South American
  genus <i>Holymenia</i> (<i>Copius</i> of older authors) consists of slender forms, having the
  elytra transparent even on the basal part like Homoptera; this and some other peculiarities give
  the species of this genus a certain resemblance to Insects of other Orders; Westwood says that
  <i>Diateina holymenoides</i> (Diptera) greatly resembles a bug of the genus <i>Holymenia</i>. The
  tropical American genus <i>Diactor</i> consists of a few species of elegant colour having the hind
  legs very peculiarly shaped, the tibiae being flattened and expanded in a sail-like manner, and
  ornamented with agreeable colours different <span class="pagenum" id="page548"><span
  class="smaller">{548}</span></span>from those on the rest of the body; they are made more
  conspicuous by the femora being remarkably long and thin; it is probable that they are used as
  ornaments. The subfamily Phyllomorphides consists of about a dozen species, and is found in
  several of the western parts of the Eastern hemisphere, one species, <i>P. laciniata</i>,
  occurring in Southern Europe. This Insect is of very delicate texture, and the sides of the body
  are directed upwards and deeply divided so that a sort of basin is formed, of which the dorsum of
  the body is the floor; the Insect is very spinose, and is thus enabled to carry its eggs, the
  spines helping to retain them in position on the back. It is said to be the male that thus carries
  the eggs. This species is able to stridulate, and when doing so vibrates its antennae with
  excessive rapidity. We have only about a score of species of Coreidae in Britain, and none of the
  remarkable forms of the family are among them.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Berytidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Very slender Insects with the first joint of the antennae
  and the femora thickened at the tips.</i>&mdash;This small family was not distinguished from
  Coreidae by the older authors. It consists of about fifty species, eight of which are found in
  Britain.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Lygaeidae.</b>&mdash;<i>The characters are the same as those mentioned for Coreidae,
  except as regards the insertion of the antennae; the upper surface or face of the head is not so
  flat, but is transversely convex, so that seen in profile the antennae appear to be inserted well
  down on the sides of the head.</i>&mdash;The name Infericornia was formerly applied to these
  Insects. They are on the average of smaller size than the members of the Coreidae or Pentatomidae,
  and are much less conspicuous in colour and form; a good many of the larger Lygaeids are, however,
  variegate with black, yellow, and red. The family is very numerous in species, about 1400 being
  known; they are arranged in thirteen sub-families; we have about sixty species in Britain, nearly
  all small. <i>Eremocoris</i> lives, when immature, in the nests of the wood-ant, according to
  Wasmann. The family includes some notorious Insect-pests. The Chinch-bug, <i>Blissus
  leucopterus</i>, commits very serious ravages on corn and grasses in North America. The
  Cotton-stainer, <i>Dysdercus suturellus</i> is also very injurious to cotton in certain parts of
  the New World: its growth has been described by Riley,<a id="NtA_485"
  href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> who thinks a dye valuable for <span class="pagenum"
  id="page549"><span class="smaller">{549}</span></span>commercial purposes might be procured from
  the Insect. This bug has recently developed the habit of sucking oranges, and has thus become
  injurious in Florida, as the fruit readily decays after it has been punctured by these Insects.
  The phenomenon of "micropterism" is exhibited by numerous Lygaeids, as well as by
  Pyrrhocoridae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Pyrrhocoridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Distinguished from Lygaeidae only by the absence of
  ocelli</i>, and not recognised as a distinct family by all Hemipterists. About 300 species are
  included. Our only British member is the notorious <i>Pyrrhocoris apterus</i>; it is, however,
  very rare in this country, though it abounds on the Continent, and has been the object of
  investigation by embryologists and others. It displays in a most marked manner the curious
  dimorphism as to the alar organs that is so common in certain divisions of Hemiptera; the elytra
  and wings being sometimes normally developed, while in other cases the wings are entirely absent,
  and the horny, basal part of the elytra only is present. In some localities, and in some years,
  only the micropterous form is found, while on other occasions there may be a large percentage of
  the macropterous form. The abundance of this Insect has enabled the French chemist Physalix to
  obtain an amount of its colouring matter sufficient for analysis; as the result he procured a
  substance, insoluble in water, very closely allied to carotine.<a id="NtA_486"
  href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a> The Oriental Insect <i>Lohita grandis</i> is one of the most
  remarkable of Bugs, the male of the Sumatran variety being over two inches in length, having
  enormously long antennae, and the abdomen extended to about twice the normal length, while the
  other sex is in the usual condition in these respects. The species is said to be injurious to the
  cotton-plant in India.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Tingidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Tarsi two-jointed. Elytra more or less reticulate, consisting
  of strong, irregular, thick lines forming a framework of cells, the enclosed part of the cell
  being of different texture and frequently transparent; antennae with terminal joint more or less
  knob-like, the preceding joint very long; ocelli wanting; pronotum prolonged behind, covering the
  scutellum; front coxae placed at the lack of the thorax.</i>&mdash;This is the first of a series
  of families with only two joints to the feet. These little bugs are very remarkable objects, and
  exhibit much variety in their peculiar <span class="pagenum" id="page550"><span
  class="smaller">{550}</span></span>sculpture, which in numerous forms attains a condition of
  elegance well worthy of attention. There are nearly 300 species known, and in Britain we have
  about a score. The characters we have given above do not apply to the genus <i>Piesma</i>, though
  it is usually placed in this family; its scutellum is not covered, and ocelli are present.
  Although but little is known as to the nature of the lives of Tingidae, yet it was pointed out
  long ago by R&eacute;aumur that a species of the family (probably <i>C. clavicorne</i>, Fig. 263), lives
  in deformations of the flowers of the Labiate plant now called <i>Teucrium chamaedrys</i>;
  Frauenfeld has more recently confirmed this observation, and shown that the closely allied <i>C.
  teucrii</i> affects the flowers of <i>T. montanum</i> in a similar manner.<a id="NtA_487"

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Aradidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Very flat, broad; scutellum exposed, large or moderate;
  abdomen broader than the alar organs, which it frequently encases like a broad frame. Front coxae
  placed in the middle of the prosternum.</i>&mdash;These very flat Insects, of obscure colour, have
  frequently very peculiar sculpture. They live under bark, or on fungi growing from bark, and are
  supposed to draw their nutriment from the fungi, though but little is actually known as to their
  natural history. The family is almost cosmopolitan, and includes about 300 species, of which five
  occur in England. The small sub-family Isoderminae consists of a few species that are placed only
  provisionally in Aradidae; they differ from the normal members by there being no groove on the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page551"><span class="smaller">{551}</span></span>breast, so that the
  rostrum is free. Of the five species, three occur in Chili and Patagonia, two in Tasmania, and one
  in Australia.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Hebridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute bugs, of semiaquatic habits, clothed beneath with a
  dense, minute, silvery pubescence; antennae five-jointed; legs of not more than average length;
  elytra in larger part membranous.</i>&mdash;This small family consists altogether of only about a
  dozen species; we have two species of the genus <i>Hebrus</i> in Britain; they are usually found
  in very wet moss.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Hydrometridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Form very diverse; antennae four-jointed, tarsi
  two-jointed. Coxae usually widely separated. Either wingless or with elytra of one texture
  throughout, having no membranous part. Under surface with a minute velvet-like pubescence. In many
  forms the legs are of great length.</i>&mdash;Although of comparatively small
  extent&mdash;scarcely 200 species being at present known&mdash;this family is of great interest
  from the habit possessed by its members of living on the surface of water. In the case of the
  notorious genus <i>Halobates</i> (Fig. 265) the Insects can even successfully defy the terrors of
  Neptune and live on the ocean many hundreds of miles from land. There is great variety of form
  among Hydrometridae. The European and British genus <i>Mesovelia</i> is of short form, and but
  little dissimilar from ordinary land-bugs, with which, indeed, it is connected by means of the
  genus <i>Hebrus</i>, already noticed. <i>Mesovelia</i> represents the sub-family Mesoveliides,
  which, though consisting of only four species, occurs in both hemispheres, and in the tropics as
  well as in the temperate regions. Our species, <i>M. furcata</i>, walks on the surface of the
  water, the movements of its legs and the position of its coxae being those of land-bugs. Another
  British Insect&mdash;the highly remarkable <i>Hydrometra stagnorum</i>&mdash;is of excessively
  slender form, with long thin legs, by aid of which it <span class="pagenum" id="page552"><span
  class="smaller">{552}</span></span>walks on the surface-film of water, above which its body is
  held well separated. It is easily drowned, and if submerged it has great difficulty in escaping
  from the water. This genus represents the sub-family Hydrometrides, and is apparently almost
  cosmopolitan. <i>Velia currens</i> is another common British Insect; it loves the eddies and
  currents of backwaters on burns and streams, and is very abundant in Scotland. An American ally,
  <i>Rhagovelia plumbea</i>, appears to be not uncommon on the surface of the ocean in the Gulf of
  Mexico, near the shores. The great majority of the family belong to the division Gerrides, of
  which the curious, long Insects that float so lazily and skim so easily on the surface of quiet
  streams are typical. The species of the genus now called <i>Gerris</i>, but formerly known as
  <i>Hydrometra</i> are apparently distributed all over the world; we have ten in Britain. They have
  very long legs, and on being alarmed move away with the greatest ease.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Halobates</i> includes at present fifteen species. They are found on the ocean,
  where the surface-water is warm, in various parts of the world. They are destitute of any trace of
  alar organs, the meso- and meta-thorax are closely united and large, while the abdomen is very
  small, so that the body is of oval form; the middle legs are thrown so far back that they are
  placed immediately over the posterior pair. When the sea is calm these Insects skim over the
  surface with rapidity, but disappear as soon as it becomes agitated. They are believed to feed on
  small animals recently deceased; Witlaczil says on the juices of jelly-fish. The young are
  frequently met with, and there can be no doubt that the whole life-cycle may be passed through by
  the Insect far away from land. The Italian ship <i>Vettor Pisani</i> met with a bird's feather
  floating on the ocean off the Galapagos Islands, covered with eggs which proved to be those of
  <i>Halobates</i> in an advanced stage of development. It was formerly believed that the female
  carries the eggs for some time after their exclusion, and although this has since been denied, it
  is nevertheless an undoubted fact, for it was observed by Mr. J. J. Walker,<a id="NtA_488"
  href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a> to whom we are indebted for a specimen having the eggs still
  attached to the body, as shown in Fig. 265. Mr. Walker believes the bugs shelter themselves when
  the sea is at all rough by keeping at a sufficient distance <span class="pagenum"
  id="page553"><span class="smaller">{553}</span></span>below the surface; they can dive with
  facility, and are gregarious. They are frequently found close to the shore, and Mr. Walker has
  even met with them on land. The stink-glands of other Hemiptera are said by Nassonoff to be
  replaced in <i>Halobates</i> by peculiar ventral glands. An allied genus, <i>Halobatodes</i>, was
  supposed to be oceanic, but this is not the case, some of the species having been found recently
  in fresh water in India, and others in estuaries at Port Darwin. A remarkable allied form,
  <i>Hermatobates haddoni</i>, was recently discovered by Professor Haddon in Torres Straits. Apart
  from the oceanic life, <i>Halobates</i> is by no means the most extraordinary of the
  Hydrometridae. The Javanese <i>Ptilomera laticaudata</i> repeats some of its peculiarities, and is
  of larger size, with the sexes very different. The most remarkable of the family is perhaps the
  fresh-water genus <i>Rheumatobates</i> (Fig. 266), in which the males have peculiar prehensile
  antennae that look like legs. These curious Insects inhabit North America and the West Indies.</p>

  <p>We may here notice an enigmatic Insect called <i>Hemidiptera haeckeli</i> by L&eacute;on. From the
  single specimen known it is concluded that the Insect has only one pair of wings, and that they
  are attached to the metathorax. It is, however, possible, as <span class="pagenum"

  short, not extending on to the breast, in repose curved under the head so as to form a loop
  therewith. Elytra, when present, consisting of three divisions. Tarsi

  Upwards of 2000 species are already known; the habits seem to be chiefly of a predaceous nature,
  the creatures drawing their nutriment from the animal rather than from the vegetable kingdom, and
  their chief prey being in all probability other kinds of Insects. There is, perhaps, no family of
  Insects exhibiting a greater variety of form and colour. The Emesids are amongst the most delicate
  of Insects, equalling in this respect the <span class="pagenum" id="page556"><span
  class="smaller">{556}</span></span>daddy-long-leg flies; they are, however, highly predaceous;
  their front legs are peculiarly formed for capturing and holding their prey, and have long coxae,
  like <i>Mantis</i>, so that these Insects are commonly mistaken for small or young Mantises, from
  which their sucking proboscis at once distinguishes them. This curious starved-looking form of bug
  reaches its maximum of peculiarity in the South American genus <i>Ghilianella</i> (Fig. 268).
  According to Pascoe the linear form enables the young larva to be carried about by the mother, the
  long slender abdomen of the larva being curled around the thorax of the parent. <i>Ploiaria
  pallida</i>, from Woodlark Island, is an Insect of excessive fragility and elegance, with the long
  thin legs coloured with alternate patches of black on a white ground, giving rise to a very
  curious appearance remarkably analogous to what we find in some of the equally delicate
  daddy-long-leg flies.</p>

  <p>We have three species of Emesides in Britain, but most of our Reduviidae belong to the
  sub-family Nabides. These approximate to ordinary bugs in appearance and characters more than do
  any other of the Reduviidae. One of our indigenous Nabides is of great interest from the curious
  resemblance it has to an ant (Fig. 269). The likeness is brought about by the sides of the base of
  the abdomen being very pallid in colour, except a dark mark in the middle; this mark is in shape
  like the pedicel of an ant. Viewed in profile it is found that on the base of the abdomen there is
  an elevation like the "scale" in this position in <span class="pagenum" id="page557"><span
  class="smaller">{557}</span></span>ants, and that the abdomen is extremely ant-like in form. This
  resemblance is quite parallel with that of an Orthopteron to an ant (see Vol. V. p. 323); the
  Insect is by no means uncommon, and it is strange that this curious case of resemblance should
  hitherto have escaped notice. The bug runs about on plants and flowers, and is frequently in
  company with ants, but we do not know whether it preys on them. Not the least remarkable of the
  facts connected with this Insect is that the resemblance is confined to the earlier instars; the
  adult bug not being like an ant. We may here mention that there are numerous bugs that closely
  resemble ants, and that on the whole there is reason to believe that the resembling forms are
  actually associated during life, though we really know very little as to this last point.</p>

  <p>The little sub-family Holoptilides, with twenty-five species, but widely distributed in the
  Eastern hemisphere, is remarkable on account of the feathered <span class="pagenum"
  id="page558"><span class="smaller">{558}</span></span>antennae and legs of its members (Fig. 270).
  Altogether fourteen sub-families are recognised, the most extensive one being Harpactorides,
  including a great variety of remarkable forms; in the South American genus <i>Notocyrtus</i>
  (better known as <i>Saccoderes</i>, Fig. 257), the prothorax is swollen and covers the body to a
  greater or less extent in the fashion of a hood. In <i>Yolinus</i> and <i>Eulyes</i> the
  coloration is the most conspicuous system that could be devised, the sides of the abdomen
  (connexivum) being expanded into bright-red lobes on which are placed patches of polished-black.
  The most remarkable form of Reduviid is, perhaps, one from China (Fig. 271) of considerable size,
  of great fragility, and greatly resembling, like some Emesides, a daddy-long-legs fly, though it
  does not belong to the Emesides. It is an altogether anomalous form. According to Seitz there is
  found on the Corcovado in Brazil a Reduviid that exactly resembles one of the dark stinging-wasps
  of the genus <i>Pepsis</i>, and the bug makes the same sort of movements as the wasp does, though
  these are of a kind quite different from those of ordinary bugs.<a id="NtA_491"

  <p>Although the attacks of Reduviidae on animals are usually confined to the smaller and more
  defenceless kinds, yet this is by no means invariably the case; there are in fact numerous species
  that do not hesitate to attack man himself. Several species of <i>Reduvius</i> do this in Southern
  Europe, and are frequently met with in houses. <i>R. personatus</i> is the only species of the
  genus in England; though far from common anywhere, it is sometimes found in houses, and is said to
  destroy the common bed-bug; it is able to pass its whole existence in our habitations, for the
  young are found as frequently as the adult, and are usually concealed by a quantity of dusty
  matter, or refuse, adhering to the body. This habit of covering the body with some foreign
  substance is natural to the Insect, the young that are found on trees being covered with matter
  derived therefrom. Darwin has given us an account of <span class="pagenum" id="page559"><span
  class="smaller">{559}</span></span>the Benchucha,<a id="NtA_492"
  href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> a bug an inch long, which in South America attacks human
  beings after the fashion of the common bed-bug. In this case no ill-effects follow the attack, but
  in the case of <i>Conorhinus sanguisuga</i> in Arizona, great pain and inflammation ensue and may
  end in the gathering and discharge of pus.</p>

  <p>Not the least remarkable of characters of <i>Reduviidae</i> is the form of the eggs of some of
  the species (Fig. 272, and Vol. V. Fig. 78, C); the egg bearing a peculiar operculum, the purpose
  of which is at present quite mysterious.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. A&euml;pophilidae.</b>&mdash;A single species forms this family. It is of considerable
  interest, as it is incapable of flight, passing a large part of its life covered by the sea.
  <i>A&euml;pophilus bonnairei is a small Insect with quite short head, without ocelli, and with the
  organs of flight represented by a pair of very short elytra, with rounded hind-margins.</i> It is
  found on the shores of Western France, and, as a great rarity, on our own south coast. It no doubt
  sucks small soft animals. In the Channel Islands it occurs in spots where it is nearly always
  covered by a considerable depth of water.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Ceratocombidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute bugs with ocelli and elytra. Rostrum free. Head
  not broad, somewhat prolonged in front; eyes close to the thorax. Elytra usually without a
  distinctly separated membrane. Tarsi three-jointed.</i>&mdash;This family includes at present only
  a few, minute, fragile bugs, that have often been classified with Cimicidae or Anthocoridae. We
  have only two British species, one of which, <i>Dipsocoris alienus</i>, is common amongst the damp
  shingle at the margins of the burns and waters of Scotland.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 15. Cimicidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Ocelli absent; elytra very short and broad, so that the
  broad abdomen is left uncovered. Head short and broad. Rostrum received in a groove beneath the
  head. Tarsi three-jointed.</i>&mdash;Although this family consists of only a dozen species, it is
  the most notorious of all the Order, as it includes the detestable <i>Cimex lectularius</i> or
  common Bed-bug. This Insect is now peculiar to the habitations of man, and is said not to trouble
  savage races; or rather it is supposed to be present only when the habitations have a certain
  degree of comfort and permanence. It has no fixed period of the year for its development, but the
  generations succeed one another so long as the temperature <span class="pagenum"
  id="page560"><span class="smaller">{560}</span></span>is sufficiently elevated; during too cold
  weather the Insects merely become stupefied, their lives being as it were interrupted till warmth
  returns. It is a favourite food with other Insects, and is destroyed by cockroaches and ants as
  well as by <i>Reduvius</i>; the small black ant <i>Monomorium</i> will, it is said, clear a house
  of the bed-bug in a few days. Nothing is really known as to the origin of this Insect; it is now
  very widely distributed. The other species of the family frequent birds and bats, and are very
  similar to the common bug. The genus to which the bed-bug belongs is in many works called
  <i>Acanthia</i> instead of <i>Cimex</i>. Other authors apply the term <i>Acanthia</i> to
  <i>Salda</i>, but it is better to allow the name <i>Acanthia</i> to fall into disuse.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 16. Anthocoridae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute bugs, usually with ocelli and with elytra; the
  latter occasionally abbreviated, but usually fully developed, with membranous tip. Head prolonged
  in the middle in front much beyond the insertion of the antennae; eyes not far from the thorax.
  Rostrum free.</i>&mdash;These small and obscure Insects appear to be rather numerous in species,
  and to be chiefly connected with woods and forests. Some of the species live in ants' nests. We
  have 27 British species belonging to 11 genera. About 200 species of the family are known. The
  members of the sub-family Microphysides are remarkable from the great dissimilarity of the sexes,
  for which it is not possible to assign any reason.</p>

  the antennae being apparently absent; they are, however, really present, being situate on the
  under side of the head, to which they are closely pressed, or in some cases placed in a pocket in
  front of each eye. There are six of these families. Schi&ouml;dte is doubtless correct in treating this

  broad, with prominent eyes, ocelli present. Hind legs thin, formed for running.</i>&mdash;The
  Insects of this family are but little known; they are only sub-aquatic in habits, frequenting damp
  places at the margins of streams and waters. The presence of ocelli distinguishes them from other
  water-bugs, with which indeed the Galgulidae appear to be but little related. There are only about
  twenty species of the family known. We possess none in Britain; but one, <i>Pelogonus

  <i>Nepa</i> and <i>Ranatra</i>. Both are widely distributed over the earth, and are rather
  numerous in species.<a id="NtA_495" href="#Nt_495"><sup>[495]</sup></a> We have one species of
  each genus in Britain. <i>Nepa cinerea</i>, the common "water-scorpion," is one of the commonest
  of Insects in Southern Britain, living concealed in shallow waters when nearly or quite stagnant.
  <i>Ranatra linearis</i> (Fig. 276) is much less common, and appears to be getting rarer; it is not
  recorded from farther north than Cambridge.</p>

  <p>The nature of the respiratory arrangements in these Insects is of considerable interest; the
  long tube at the extremity of the body consists of two parts (as shown in Fig. 276) brought
  together in the middle, one from each side. Lacaze-Duthiers states that the processes are
  elongated pleurae, but in the young it is far from clear that this is the case. However that may
  be, they seem to convey air to the true breathing organs, situate inside the cleft on the apical
  part of the abdomen itself; but details as to the way in which transfer of air is effected along
  this <span class="pagenum" id="page564"><span class="smaller">{564}</span></span>very protracted
  passage are not forthcoming. The development in <i>Nepa</i> has been studied to a certain extent.
  The apical stigmata are the only pair of the abdominal stigmata that exist in the imago of
  <i>Nepa</i>, the other six pairs being obliterated; the third, fourth, and fifth, according to
  Schi&ouml;dte, in a very peculiar manner: hence, as Martin says,<a id="NtA_496"
  href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> the respiratory system is metapneustic. In an earlier stage of
  the life, however, these six pairs of stigmata exist in functional activity placed in a groove on
  the under surface of the body; so that the condition is that termed peripneustic, and remains so
  till the final moult, when the long siphon appears. In the early life there is a short
  prolongation from the end of the body in connection with the pair of grooves alluded to, but it is
  a single unpaired organ, and does little therefore to explain the appearance of the siphon, which
  must, at present, be considered as being suddenly developed at the last moult.</p>

  <p>The eggs of Nepidae are remarkable objects; that of the common water-scorpion bears seven
  filaments at one end (Fig. 277); while that of <i>Ranatra</i> is more elongate, and bears only
  two, very elongate, threads. These eggs are deposited in the stems of water-plants, being
  introduced therein, so that the body of the egg is concealed while the threads project: those of
  <i>Ranatra</i> are placed in stems floating on the water, and in consequence of the threads the
  stems look as if they were infested by some fungus. The structure and formation of the eggs have
  been investigated with considerable detail by Korschelt.<a id="NtA_497"
  href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a> He looks on the filaments as pneumatic, and considers that
  they supply a coating of air to the body of the egg; they consist of a spongy mass encircled by
  two layers of egg-shell, both of these latter being peculiar in structure; the spongy mass is
  continuous with a layer of the same kind of substance placed on the interior of the shell of the
  body <span class="pagenum" id="page565"><span class="smaller">{565}</span></span>of the egg. It
  will be recollected that we have described (p. 562) an egg, apparently of the same nature,
  deposited by Capsids in the stems of land plants, so that it is very doubtful whether the threads
  are really connected with the aquatic development of the embryo in Nepidae. But the most
  interesting feature connected with these eggs is, according to Korschelt, the mode of development
  of the filaments, which is <i>sui generis</i>; the shell of the egg is developed in the ordinary
  manner as an exudation or excretion from epithelial cells; but the shell of the filament is formed
  as an intracellular product; a mode of chitin-formation that appears to be peculiar to this
  structure. Korschelt remarks that "it is in the highest degree worthy of attention how by any
  process of development through a large number of successive generations so complex a condition
  could be established as the result of adaptation to external conditions; and this becomes even
  more interesting when we remember that highly peculiar special processes and departures from the
  usual modes of tissue-formation are necessary to permit the development of this apparatus."<a

  <p>They appear to be unable to resist the attraction of artificial light, and are consequently
  sometimes destroyed in large numbers. It has long been known that species of the genera
  <i>Diplonychus</i> and <i>Zaitha</i> carry their eggs on their backs. There is no special
  receptacle for the purpose, but the eggs are kept in their peculiar position by means of a cement
  insoluble in water. It has been stated by Dimmock that they are placed in position by means of a
  long, flexible ovipositor. Schmidt, however, found that a specimen of <i>Diplonychus</i>, bearing
  eggs and examined by him, was a male, and he subsequently found that this was the case with other
  egg-bearing individuals of other species, so that the mode in which the eggs are placed in this
  position and the object of so curious a habit, remain uncertain. The species of <i>Belostoma</i>
  are highly remarkable on account of the curious and complex structure of their antennae, in
  respect of which the nearest analogy is to be found in the large Coleoptera of the genus
  <i>Hydrophilus</i>. A very deep, ear-like pocket, exactly suited to the form of the antennae,
  exists on the under side of the head; hence in repose no sign of the peculiar shape of the
  antennae exists. When the antennae are placed in this ear-like pocket only the one side of the
  basal joints is exposed, the long processes being received into the deep pocket. In
  <i>Hydrophilus</i> the antenna is used as an accessory organ of respiration, and it will be
  interesting to learn whether this is also the case in <i>Belostoma</i>. Belostomidae have patches
  of air-carrying pubescence, analogous with those of <i>Hydrophilus</i>, on the under sides of the
  body, elytra and wings, but we do not <span class="pagenum" id="page567"><span
  class="smaller">{567}</span></span>know how they are charged. Another extremely interesting
  analogy is found in the manner in which the elytra are locked to the body; a projection from the
  thoracic side-pieces, forming a long pouch, into which a fold on the inner side of the elytra
  fits, the two being subsequently locked by the action of some special projections. This
  arrangement is similar to that which exists in the anomalous family of water-beetles Pelobiidae.
  In order to make this mechanism more perfect the side-pieces in <i>Belostoma</i> form free
  processes. Martin has informed us that the young have the metasternal episternum prolonged to form
  a lamella that he thinks may be for respiratory purposes.<a id="NtA_499"
  href="#Nt_499"><sup>[499]</sup></a> About twelve genera and upwards of fifty species of
  Belostomidae are known. None exist in our isles, but several species extend their range to
  Southern Europe. In the waters of the warm regions of the continents of both the Old and New
  Worlds they are common Insects, but as yet they have not been found in Australia.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 24. Notonectidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Prosternum short, so that the legs are placed near the
  back part of it as well as near the front; back of the head overlapped by the front of the
  pronotum.</i>&mdash;The water-boatmen are extremely common in our ponds, where they may be seen
  rising to the surface and raising the posterior extremity of the body for breathing. They swim on
  their backs instead of in the usual position, and have an elaborate arrangement of long hairs on
  the body to assist them to carry about an air-supply. They are said to be lighter than the water,
  and to have some difficulty in keeping away from the surface. <i>Notonecta glauca</i> is the only
  British species, but we have a second minute Insect, <i>Plea minutissima</i>, belonging to the
  family. It lies in the mud at the bottom of shallow waters, and may sometimes be fished up in
  great numbers. It is considered by some authors to form a distinct family. The oviposition of
  <i>Notonecta</i> has been observed by Regimbart; the eggs are inserted into the stems of aquatic
  plants.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 25. Corixidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Prosternum short, as in Notonectidae; summit of
  the head free from the thorax.</i>&mdash;We have numerous species of the genus Corixa in Britain;
  and others extremely similar in appearance occur in various parts of the world. The head is
  remarkably free, and capable of great rotation. On dissection it is found to be attached to the
  thorax only by a <span class="pagenum" id="page568"><span
  class="smaller">{568}</span></span>narrow area; in this respect it differs widely from
  <i>Notonecta</i>, which possesses an extremely large occipital foramen, and the head of which
  possesses but little freedom of movement. The extremely short proboscis is more or less
  retractile, and therefore frequently appears absent. A second British genus consists of a single
  species, <i>Sigara minutissima</i>. These Insects, unlike <i>Notonecta</i>, are quite at home
  beneath the water, where they scurry about with extreme rapidity, and occur sometimes in enormous
  numbers. In Mexico the eggs of <i>Corixa americana</i> and of <i>C. femorata</i> are used as food,
  and are said to be very nice. The Insects themselves are used as food in both Mexico and Egypt.
  The species of this family can make a noise beneath the water by rubbing the front feet against
  the proboscis.<a id="NtA_500" href="#Nt_500"><sup>[500]</sup></a> The males have a very complex
  asymmetry of the terminal segments, and in some species possess on one side of the dorsal surface
  a curious asymmetrical organ consisting of rows of very closely-packed, intensely black, comb-like
  plates, called by Buchanan White a strigil. This organ seems to be similar to the peculiar
  structures found on the terminal segments of certain species of Scutellerides.</p>

  where the whole creature, including the wings, is highly pigmented in a showy manner; frequently
  in black and yellow. Cicadas are said to be without any special protection, and to be destroyed in
  considerable numbers by birds and other animals. The body is broad and robust, and is never shaped

  <p>Cicadidae are almost confined to the warmer regions of the earth, but we have one species, a
  great rarity, in the extreme south of England; altogether there are about 800 species known. These
  Insects are seen above ground&mdash;so far as the life-histories are at present known&mdash;only
  in the perfect condition, the creatures in their earlier stages being subterranean and living on
  roots. As soon as the individual comes out of the ground it splits open the nymph-skin, and the
  perfect Cicada emerges. One species&mdash;the North American <i>Cicada septendecim</i>&mdash;is a
  most notorious Insect owing to its life-cycle of seventeen years. It is considered that the
  individual, after nearly seventeen years of underground existence, comes to the surface and lives
  for a brief period the life of a noisy Insect. This is the only Insect at present known having so
  considerable a longevity. This fact, and several other peculiarities, have attracted much
  attention, so that there is an extensive literature connected with the seventeen-year Cicada. It
  has a wide distribution over the United States, but does not confine its appearance to every
  seventeenth year, being found somewhere or other&mdash;frequently in numerous
  localities&mdash;almost every year. The evidence as to its periodicity has been obtained by taking
  the locality and other points into consideration as well as the year of appearance. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page570"><span class="smaller">{570}</span></span>By so doing it has been
  found possible to establish the existence of twenty-two broods which are distinguished by
  consecutive numeration. This being done, the evidence as to the years during which Cicadas have
  appeared in any given locality is examined, and the result is believed to bear out the view that
  the life-cycle of the individual Insect is really one of seventeen years. According to this view
  there are, underground, in certain localities individuals of different ages that will appear on
  the surface as mature individuals in different years. Thus in 1885 it was understood that there
  were underground in Alabama two broods, viz. brood xviii. that would appear on the surface in
  1894, and brood iv. that would appear on the surface in 1896. The predictions made as to the years
  in which Cicadas would appear in some given locality are considered to have proved correct.
  Moreover, particular entomologists have in certain localities verified by personal examination the
  appearance of the Insects for several consecutive periods of seventeen years. These facts appear
  fairly conclusive, but they are much complicated by another point, viz. that in certain localities
  the period is one of thirteen, not of seventeen, years. This is to some extent a question of
  climate, the thirteen-year interval being chiefly characteristic of the Southern States. It is
  not, however, entirely so, for there are localities in which the broods have an interval of either
  thirteen years or seventeen years. Another fact should be remembered, viz. that it is admitted
  that not quite all the individuals of a particular brood are true to their proper time of
  appearance; in other words, a few specimens may appear precociously a year or two before their
  comrades, while some may lag behind to a considerable extent. It is therefore a matter for great
  surprise that, under these circumstances, the broods should keep distinct at all, for one would
  suppose that time-variation of this kind would lead to completely obscuring the distinctness of
  the broods. We must also call attention to the fact that both the seventeen-year and the
  thirteen-year broods have a dimorphic form, or sub-species, called <i>C. cassinii</i> which
  accompanies the ordinary form, with which it is apparently as a rule not connected by
  intermediates.<a id="NtA_502" href="#Nt_502"><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page571"><span class="smaller">{571}</span></span></div>

  <p>Cicadidae are provided with powerful ovipositors. The eggs of <i>C. septendecim</i> are
  deposited in the woody stems of bushes; after remaining there a few weeks the young hatch out,
  drop to the ground, and, as previously stated, disappear for nearly seventeen years, nearly the
  whole of which time is passed in the larval state, the nymph-condition existing for only a few
  days. They feed on the roots of various trees; it has been said that they are injurious in this
  way, but other authorities maintain that they suck only a moist exudation from the roots. It is
  very difficult to obtain information as to their strange, prolonged, subterranean life; it said
  that the Insects sometimes penetrate to a great depth&mdash;ten feet, even twenty feet are
  mentioned;&mdash;and as great changes may take place on the surface during their long lives, these
  Insect Rip Van Winkles sometimes emerge in very strange conditions, and may appear even in deep
  cellars. When the pupa comes to the surface it hooks itself on to the stem of some plant or other
  object, the skin of the back splits, and the Cicada emerges. Among the inexplicable peculiarities
  of this Insect must be mentioned the fact that when emerging it sometimes constructs chimneys, or
  flues, extending several inches above the surface of the ground. The reason for this is much
  disputed; it was said that they are for refuge against inundations, but this appears to be very
  doubtful. Certain of the broods consist of an almost incalculable number of individuals, and it is
  very strange to hear woods, or other localities, that have been for many years free from these
  Insects, all at once resounding with their noisy song. The seventeen-year Cicada is considered to
  be doomed to a speedy extinction; the extension of cultivation and building, and the introduction
  to America of the English sparrow, are likely to prove too much for the Insect.</p>

  <p>Although Hemiptera are classified by many among the Ametabola or Insects without metamorphosis,
  it is impossible to deny that the Cicadidae exhibit a considerable amount of metamorphosis, and
  they are usually mentioned as exceptional. The young (Fig. 280, A) is totally unlike the adult in
  form and colour, and maintains, to a certain extent, its existence by the aid of a different set
  of implements. The larva of the Cicada is colourless, with an integument of very feeble
  consistence, rather large antennae, and a remarkable pair of fossorial legs; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page572"><span class="smaller">{572}</span></span>the wings are totally wanting. The mode of
  passage from the larval to the pupal state has not been recorded. The pupa, or nymph, differs from
  the larva by its much shorter, compressed form; by being encased in a remarkably hard shell; and
  by the antennae approximating in form to those of the adult. It has short wing-pads at the sides
  of the body; the front legs are remarkably powerful, and the creature is capable of moving about;
  the imago escapes from the pupa by the splitting dorsally of the middle of the thoracic segments.
  The empty pupa-skin does not shrivel, but retains its form, and in countries where Cicadas occur,
  frequently attracts attention by the strange form it presents, being often placed in a conspicuous
  position.</p>

  <p><b>Song.</b>&mdash;Cicadas are the most noisy of the Insect world; the shrilling of
  grasshoppers and even of crickets being insignificant in comparison with the voice of Cicada.
  Darwin heard them in South America when the <i>Beagle</i> was anchored a quarter of a mile from
  the shore; and <i>Tympanoterpes gigas</i>, from the same region, is said to make a noise equal to
  the whistle of a locomotive.<a id="NtA_503" href="#Nt_503"><sup>[503]</sup></a> A curious
  difference of opinion prevails as to whether their song is agreeable or not; in some countries
  they are kept in cages, while in others they are considered a nuisance. The Greeks are said to
  have decided in favour of their performances, the Latins against them. Only the males sing, the
  females being completely dumb; this has given rise to a saying by a Greek poet (so often repeated
  that it bids fair to become immortal) "Happy the Cicadas' lives, for they all have voiceless
  wives."<a id="NtA_504" href="#Nt_504"><sup>[504]</sup></a> The writer considers the songs of the
  European species he has heard far from unpleasant, but he is an entomologist, and therefore
  favourably prepossessed; and he admits that Riley's description of the performances of the
  seventeen-year Cicada is far from a satisfactory testimonial to the good taste of that Insect;
  Riley says, "The general noise, on approaching the infested woods, is a combination of that of a
  distant threshing-machine and a distant frog-pond. That which they make when disturbed, mimics a
  nest of young snakes or young birds under similar circumstances&mdash;a sort of scream. They can
  also produce <span class="pagenum" id="page573"><span class="smaller">{573}</span></span>a chirp
  somewhat like that of a cricket and a very loud, shrill screech prolonged for fifteen or twenty
  seconds, and gradually increasing in force and then decreasing." The object, or use of the noise
  is very doubtful; it is said that it attracts the females to the males. "De gustibus non est
  disputandum!" perhaps, however, there may be some tender notes that we fail to perceive; and it
  may be that the absence of any definite organs of hearing reduces the result of a steam-engine
  whistle to the equivalent of an agreeable whisper. No special auditory organs have been detected<a
  id="NtA_505" href="#Nt_505"><sup>[505]</sup></a> as we have already intimated; and certain
  naturalists, amongst whom we may mention Giard, think that the Insects do not hear in our sense of
  the word, but feel rhythmical vibrations; it is also recorded that though very shy the Insects may
  be induced to approach any one who will stand still and clap his hands&mdash;in good
  measure&mdash;within the range of their sensibilities. There is a good deal of support to the idea
  that the males sing in rivalry.</p>

  <p><b>Vocal structures.</b>&mdash;Although we may not be able to pronounce a final opinion as to
  the value to the Insect of the sounds, yet we cannot withhold our admiration from the structures
  from which they proceed. These are indeed so complex that they must be ranked as amongst the most
  remarkable voice-organs in the animal kingdom. They are totally different from the stridulating
  organs that are found in many other Insects, and are indeed quite peculiar to the Cicadidae. Some
  difference of opinion has existed as to the manner in which the structures act, but the account
  given by Carlet, some of whose figures we reproduce, will, we believe, be found to be essentially
  correct. The structures are partly thoracic and partly abdominal. On examining a male
  <i>Cicada</i> there will be seen on the under surface two plates&mdash;the opercula&mdash;usually
  meeting in the middle line of the body and overlapping the base of the abdomen to a greater or
  less extent according to the species, sometimes nearly covering this part of the body; these are
  enlargements of the metathoracic epimera; they can be slightly moved away from the abdomen, and,
  as the latter part is capable of a still greater extent of movement, a wide fissure may be
  produced, displaying the complex <span class="pagenum" id="page574"><span
  class="smaller">{574}</span></span>structures. In order to see the parts it is better to cut away
  an operculum; underneath it three membranes can be seen, an external, the timbal; an anterior, the
  folded or soft membrane; and a posterior, the mirror. This last is a most beautiful object,
  tensely stretched and pellucid, yet reflecting light so as to be of varied colours; there are also
  three stigmata, and some chambers connected with the apparatus. The sound is primarily produced by
  the vibrations of the timbal, to which a muscle is attached; the other membranes are probably also
  thrown into a condition of vibration, and the whole skeleton of the Insect helps to increase or
  modify the sound, which is probably also influenced by the position of the opercula. The stigmata
  probably play an important part by regulating the tension of the air in the chambers. In the
  female some of the structures are present in a rudimentary form, but there are no muscles, and
  this sex appears to be really quite voiceless.</p>

  <p>This family is of large extent, and includes at present so great a variety of forms that it is
  really almost impossible to frame a definition that will apply to all. The unusual situation of
  the ocelli and the peculiar second joint of the antennae must at present be taken as the best
  diagnostic characters: occasionally a third ocellus is present. Some of the Fulgoridae are amongst
  the largest Insects, others are quite small. The family includes the so-called Lantern-flies, in
  which the front of the head forms a huge misshapen proboscis that was formerly believed to be
  luminous. Many of the species are of brilliant or beautiful coloration. A great many&mdash;and of
  very different kinds&mdash;have the curious power of excreting large quantities of a white,
  flocculent wax. This is exhibited by our little British Insects of the genus <i>Cixius</i>, and in
  some of the exotic forms is carried to an extent that becomes a biological puzzle. The Tropical
  American genus <i>Phenax</i> may be cited as an example; being about an inch long it flies about
  with a large mass of this waxy substance twice as long as itself; indeed, in the Mexican <i>P.
  auricoma</i>, the waxy processes are four or five inches long. This wax forms a favourite food of
  certain kinds of Lepidoptera, and two or three larvae of a maggot-like nature may frequently be
  found concealed in the wax of the live Fulgorids; this has been recorded by Westwood as occurring
  in India; and Champion has observed it in the New World.<a id="NtA_506"
  href="#Nt_506"><sup>[506]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page576"><span
  class="smaller">{576}</span></span>The wax of Fulgorids is used by the Chinese for candles and
  other purposes; and this white Insect-wax is said to be much esteemed in India. Very curious
  chemical substances have been obtained from it, but its importance in the economy of the Insects
  that produce it is quite obscure. We have about seventy species of Fulgoridae in Britain. They
  belong to the subfamilies Tettigometrides, Issides, Cixiides, and Delphacides, which by many
  authors are treated as separate families. The exotic subfamily Flatides is highly peculiar. In
  some of its members the head is very different from that of the ordinary forms, being narrow, and
  the vertex and front forming a continuous curve. Some of these Insects are remarkably like
  butterflies or moths (<i>e.g.</i> the African <i>Ityraea nigrocincta</i> and the species of the
  genus <i>Pochazia</i>), but the young are totally unlike the old, the posterior part of the body
  bearing a large bush of curled, waxy projections, several times the size of the rest of the
  body.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Membracidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Prothorax prolonged backwards into a hood or processes of
  diverse forms; antennae inserted in front of the eyes; ocelli two, placed between the two
  eyes.</i>&mdash;This family is of large extent but its members are chiefly tropical, and are
  specially abundant in America. Although not of large size the Membracidae are unsurpassed for the
  variety and grotesqueness of their shapes, due to the unusual development of the pronotum. We
  figure two of these forms (Fig. 283).<a id="NtA_507" href="#Nt_507"><sup>[507]</sup></a> Very
  little is known about their <span class="pagenum" id="page577"><span
  class="smaller">{577}</span></span>habits and life-histories. We have only two species of the
  family in Britain, and these do not afford any ground for supposing that there are any
  peculiarities in their lives at all commensurate with the oddness of the Insect's structures. Belt
  has recorded the fact that in Nicaragua the larvae of certain Homoptera were assiduously attended
  by ants for the sake of a sweet juice excreted by the bugs, but it is by no means clear that these
  larvae were really those of Membracidae. In North America <i>Ceresa bubalus</i> and <i>C.
  taurina</i> place their eggs in an extremely neat manner in the woody twigs of trees. The young
  have but little resemblance to the adults, the great thoracic hood being absent, while on the back
  there is on each segment a pair of long, sub-erect processes having fringed, or minutely spiny,
  margins.<a id="NtA_508" href="#Nt_508"><sup>[508]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Cercopidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Ocelli two (occasionally absent) placed on the vertex;
  antennae placed between the eyes. Thorax not peculiarly formed.</i>&mdash;In the characteristic
  forms of this family the front of the vertex bears a suture, touched on each side by one at right
  angles to it, or converging to it so as to form a triangle or a sort of embrasure; the hind tibiae
  have only one to three strong spines. The Cercopidae are much less extraordinary than many of the
  previously considered families. But some of them have the habit of secreting a large quantity of
  fluid; and when in the immature stages, certain of them have the art of emitting the liquid in the
  form of bubbles which accumulate round the Insect and conceal it. These accumulations of fluid are
  called cuckoo-spits or frog-spits; and the perfect Insects are known as frog-hoppers, their power
  of leaping being very great. The most abundant of the frog-hoppers in our gardens is <i>Philaenus
  spumarius</i>, a little Insect of about a quarter of an inch long, obscurely coloured, with more
  or less definite pale spots; it is so variable in colour that it has received scores of names.
  Some of the Insects do not use their fluid in this manner, but eject it in the form of drops, and
  sometimes cast them to a considerable distance. The phenomena known as weeping-trees are due to
  Cercopidae; some of the species make such copious exudations of this kind that the drops have been
  compared to a shower of rain. In Madagascar it is said that <i>Ptyelus goudoti</i> exudes so much
  fluid that five or six dozen larvae would about fill a <span class="pagenum" id="page578"><span
  class="smaller">{578}</span></span>quart vessel in an hour and a half. The frog-spit is considered
  by some naturalists to be a protective device; the larvae are, however, a favourite food with
  certain Hymenoptera, which pick out the larvae from the spits and carry them off to be used as
  stores of provision for their larvae. In Ceylon the larva of <i>Machaerota guttigera</i>
  constructs tubes fixed to the twigs of the tulip-tree, and from the tube water is exuded drop by
  drop. According to Westwood, this Insect is intermediate between Cercopidae and Membracidae.<a
  id="NtA_509" href="#Nt_509"><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Jassidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Ocelli two, placed just on the front margin of the head
  (almost in a line with the front of the eyes or more to the front) or on the deflexed frons. Hind
  tibiae usually with many spines.</i> This vaguely limited family includes a very large number of
  small or minute Insects, usually of narrow, parallel form, and frequently excessively delicate and
  fragile. They are often mentioned under the name of Cicadellinae. Ashmead distinguishes two
  families, Bythoscopidae, in which the ocelli are clearly on the frons or front, and Jassidae, in
  which they are on the upper edge thereof. <i>Ulopa</i>, <i>Ledra</i>, and a few other exceptional
  forms, are also by many distinguished as representatives of distinct families. Very little is
  actually known as to the life-histories of these small and fragile Insects, but it is believed
  that the eggs are usually deposited in the leaves or stems of plants, and more particularly of
  grasses. In North America the development of <i>Deltocephalus inimicus</i>, from hatching to
  assumption of the adult form, has been observed by Webster to occupy about six weeks. As Jassidae
  are numerous both in species and individuals it is believed that they consume a considerable part
  of the vegetation of pastures. Osborn has calculated that on an acre of pasture there exist, as a
  rule, about one million of these hoppers, and he considers they obtain quite as large a share of
  the food as the Vertebrates feeding with them.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Psyllidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute Insects with wings usually transparent, placed in a
  roof-like manner over the body; with three ocelli, and rather long, thin antennae of eight to ten
  joints. Tarsi two-jointed.</i>&mdash;These small Insects have been studied chiefly in Europe and
  North America, very little information having yet been obtained as to the exotic forms. They are
  about the <span class="pagenum" id="page579"><span class="smaller">{579}</span></span>size of
  Aphidae, but in form and general appearance remind one rather of Cicadidae. The wings are in many
  cases even more perfectly transparent than they are in many Cicadidae. They are sometimes called
  springing plant-lice, as their habit of jumping distinguishes them from the Aphidae. L&ouml;w has
  called attention to the remarkable variation in colour they present in conformity with either the
  age of the individual, the food-plant, the climate, and, more particularly, the season of the
  year.<a id="NtA_510" href="#Nt_510"><sup>[510]</sup></a> R&eacute;aumur long since pointed out that at
  their ecdyses these Insects go through a remarkable series of changes of colour, and L&ouml;w found
  that this did not take place in the normal manner in the winter generation that hibernates. This
  has been confirmed by Slingerland in North America in the case of <i>Psylla pyricola</i>,<a
  id="NtA_511" href="#Nt_511"><sup>[511]</sup></a> which has been introduced there. He finds that
  there are several generations in the year, and that the hibernating adults differ from the summer
  adults in size, being nearly one-third larger; in their much darker colouring; and especially in
  the coloration of the front wings.</p>

  <p>In the earlier stages, Psyllidae differ greatly in appearance from the adult forms; the legs
  and antennae in the newly hatched larvae are short, and have a less number of joints. In the nymph
  the shape is very peculiar, the large wing-pads standing out horizontally <span class="pagenum"
  id="page580"><span class="smaller">{580}</span></span>from the sides of the body, so that the
  width of the creature is about as great as the length. The period occupied by the development
  apparently varies according to season. Witlaczil, who has given an account of many details of the
  anatomy and histology of various Psyllidae,<a id="NtA_512" href="#Nt_512"><sup>[512]</sup></a>
  considers that there are four larval stages; Heeger's account of <i>Psylla succincta</i> is not
  quite clear on this point, and Slingerland indicates a stage more than this, the perfect Insect
  being disclosed as the result of a fifth moult; it is probable that he is correct. In these
  earlier stages the body bears long hairs called wax-hairs; according to Witlaczil in the young
  larvae of certain species&mdash;<i>Trioza rhamni</i>, e.g.&mdash;these are broad and flat, so as
  to make the body appear studded with oval processes; he states that these hairs change their form
  during the growth of the individual. Nothing is more remarkable in Psyllidae than the amount of
  matter they secrete or exude from their bodies; in some species the substance is a "honey-dew,"
  and the nymph may keep itself covered with a drop of it: in other cases it is solid, as shown in
  R&eacute;aumur's figures of <i>P. buxi</i>, where this exudation forms a string several times longer than
  the body, and attached to it. Another form of exudation is a light downy or waxy matter.
  Slingerland says that honey-dew was exuded by <i>P. pyricola</i> in such quantities that it
  "literally rained from the trees upon the vegetation beneath; in cultivating the orchard the back
  of the horse and the harness often became covered with the sticky substance dropping from the
  trees. It attracts thousands of ants, bees, and wasps, which feed upon it." The writer last year
  observed in the New Forest a stunted sloe-bush, about which a large number of Bombi were busily
  occupied; and examination showed that they were thrusting their proboscides into the curled and
  deformed leaves, in which were secreted nymphs of a <i>Psylla</i> exuding honey-dew. It must not
  be assumed that this honey-dew is the excrement of the Insect; this also is known, and is a
  different substance. Those who have tasted it say that the honey-dew has a clean, good flavour.
  The source of the honey-dew is not quite certain, but it seems probable that it comes, like the
  solid matter figured by R&eacute;aumur, directly from the alimentary canal, and not from hairs or pores
  on the body. Psyllidae give rise to definite formations or galls on certain plants; sometimes
  these Psyllid galls are mere changes in form of a limited part, or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page581"><span class="smaller">{581}</span></span>parts, of a leaf, giving rise either to
  crumpling or to growth of a portion in one direction only, so that on one surface of the leaf a
  swelling is formed, and on the opposite side a more or less deep cavity in which the Insect
  dwells. A formation of this kind on the leaves of <i>Aegopodium podagraria</i> is described by
  Thomas<a id="NtA_513" href="#Nt_513"><sup>[513]</sup></a> who states that the growth is due to the
  deposition of an egg of the <i>Psylla</i>, and is independent of the after life of the Insect; a
  fungus&mdash;<i>Puccinia aegopodii</i>&mdash;forms similar structures on the leaves. Structures
  much more definite than this may be the result of the attacks of Psyllidae; for an example the
  reader may refer to R&eacute;aumur's account of <i>Psylla buxi</i>.<a id="NtA_514"
  href="#Nt_514"><sup>[514]</sup></a> In Australia and Tasmania there are Psyllidae known as Laap or
  Lerp Insects, the products of which are called leaf-manna or Lerp, and are used as food. This
  manna is a scale produced by the young Insect on the leaves of <i>Eucalyptus</i> as a covering or
  protection. The scale is fastened to the leaf by a hinge, and is somewhat like the shell of a
  cockle. Although the scales are said to be in some cases objects of great beauty, very little is
  known about these Australian Psyllidae, one of which has, however, been referred by Schwarz to the
  genus <i>Spondyliaspis</i>, Signoret.<a id="NtA_515" href="#Nt_515"><sup>[515]</sup></a> About 160

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Aphidae</b> (<i>Plant-lice or Green-fly.</i>)&mdash;<i>Minute Insects; as usually
  met with destitute of wings, though many individuals have two pairs of transparent wings. Antennae
  long, or moderately long, three- to seven-jointed; abdomen frequently with a pair of tubes
  (siphons), or short processes on the upper side of the fifth abdominal segment. Tarsi two-jointed,
  first joint sometimes excessively short.</i>&mdash;These soft-skinned Insects are frequently
  called blight, and are so abundant in temperate climates that a garden, however small, is sure to
  afford abundance of specimens during the warm months of the year. This great abundance is due to
  peculiarities in the physiological processes that render these obscure little animals highly
  important creatures; the individual life for several generations is restricted to constant, or at
  any rate copious, imbibition of food, accompanied by an almost uninterrupted <span class="pagenum"
  id="page582"><span class="smaller">{582}</span></span>production of young by parthenogenetic
  females, the young so produced becoming rapidly (sometimes in the course of eight or ten days, but
  more usually in about twenty days) themselves devoted to a similar process; so that in the
  comparatively short period of a few months the progeny resulting from a single individual is
  almost innumerable. This remarkable state of affairs is accompanied by other peculiarities of
  physiology, with the result that the life-histories of successive generations become very diverse,
  and complex cycles of series of generations differing more or less from one another are passed
  through, the species finally returning to bi-sexual reproduction, and thus inaugurating another
  cycle of generations. The surprising nature of these facts has in the last 150 years caused an
  immense amount of discussion, but no satisfactory light has yet been thrown on the conditions that
  really give rise to the exceptional phenomena. These phenomena are (1) parthenogenesis; (2)
  oviparous and viviparous reproduction; (3) the production of generations of individuals in which
  the sexes are very unequally represented, males being frequently entirely absent; (4) the
  production of individuals differing as to the acquirement of wings, some remaining entirely
  apterous, while others go on to the winged form; (5) the production of individuals of the same sex
  with different sexual organs, and distinctions in the very early (but not the earliest) stages of
  the formation of the individual; (6) differences in the life-habits of successive generations; (7)
  differences in the habits of individuals of one generation, giving rise to the phenomenon of
  parallel series. All these phenomena may occur in the case of a single species, though in a very
  variable extent.</p>

  <p>The simple form of Aphid life may be described as follows:&mdash;eggs are laid in the autumn,
  and hatch in the spring, giving rise to females of an imperfect character having no wings; these
  produce living young parthenogenetically, and this process may be repeated for a few or for many
  generations, and there may be in these generations a greater or less number of winged individuals,
  and perhaps a few males.<a id="NtA_517" href="#Nt_517"><sup>[517]</sup></a> After a time when
  temperature falls, <span class="pagenum" id="page583"><span class="smaller">{583}</span></span>or
  when the supply of food is less in quantity, or after a period of deliberate abstention from food,
  sexual individuals are produced and fertilised eggs are laid which hatch in the spring, and the
  phenomena are repeated. In other cases these phenomena are added to or rendered more complicated
  by the intercalated parthenogenetic generations exhibiting well-marked metamorphosis, of kinds
  such as occur in apterous or in winged Insects; while again the habits of successive generations
  may differ greatly, the individuals of some generations dwelling in galls, while those of other
  generations live underground on roots.</p>

  <p><b>Parthenogenesis.</b>&mdash;Returning to the various kinds of peculiarities we have
  enumerated on the preceding page, we may remark that the phenomena of parthenogenesis have been
  thoroughly established as occurring in Aphidae since Bonnet discovered the fact 150 years ago; and
  though they have not been investigated in much detail it is known that the parthenogenesis is
  usually accompanied by the production of young all of the female sex. In other cases males are
  parthenogenetically produced; but whether these males come from a female that produces only that
  sex is not yet, so far as the writer knows, established. A note by Lichtenstein<a id="NtA_518"
  href="#Nt_518"><sup>[518]</sup></a> suggests that usually only one sex is produced by a
  parthenogenetic female, but that both sexes are sometimes so produced. There is not at present any
  species of Aphid known to be perpetuated by an uninterrupted series of parthenogenetic
  generations. It was formerly supposed that there are no males at all in <i>Chermes</i>, but, as we
  shall subsequently show, this was erroneous. It has, however, been observed that a series of such
  generations may be continued without interruption for a period of four years, and we have no
  reason to suppose that even this could not be much exceeded under favourable conditions. The
  parthenogenetic young may be produced either viviparously or oviparously, according to
  species.</p>

  <p><b>Oviparous and viviparous reproduction.</b>&mdash;The distinction between these two processes
  has been extensively discussed, some naturalists maintaining that they are thoroughly distinct
  <i>ab initio</i>. This view, however, cannot be sustained. The best <span class="pagenum"
  id="page584"><span class="smaller">{584}</span></span>authorities are agreed that in the earliest
  processes of individualisation the ovum, and the pseudovum<a id="NtA_519"
  href="#Nt_519"><sup>[519]</sup></a> giving rise to a viviparous individual, are indistinguishable.
  Leydig, Huxley, Balbiani, and Lemoine are agreed as to this. Nevertheless, differences in the
  development occur extremely early. The nature of these differences may be briefly described by
  saying that in the viviparous forms the embryonic development sets in before the formation of the
  egg is properly completed. Balbiani says, "In fact at this moment [when the viviparous development
  is commencing] the germ [pseudovum] is far from having obtained the development it is capable of,
  and from having accumulated all the matter necessary for the increase of the embryo, so that the
  evolution of the former coincides, so to speak, with that of the latter. On the other hand, in the
  true ovum the two processes are chronologically separate, for the rudiment of the new individual
  never appears before the egg has completed the growth of its constituent parts."<a id="NtA_520"
  href="#Nt_520"><sup>[520]</sup></a> As regards the difference in structure of the organs of
  viviparously and oviparously producing individuals, it is sufficient to remark that they are not
  of great importance, being apparently confined to certain parts remaining rudimentary in the
  former. Leydig, indeed, found an <i>Aphis</i> in which certain of the egg-tubes contained eggs in
  various stages of development, and others embryos in all stages.<a id="NtA_521"
  href="#Nt_521"><sup>[521]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As regards the physiology of production of winged and wingless individuals there has been but
  little exact inquiry. Vast numbers of individuals may be produced without any winged forms
  occurring, while on the other hand these latter are occasionally so abundant as to float about in
  swarms that darken the air; the two forms are probably, however, determined by the supply of food.
  The winged forms are less prolific than the apterous forms; and Forbes has noticed in <i>Aphis
  maidi-radicis</i>, where the generations consist partly of apterous and partly of winged
  individuals, that when the corn begins to flag in consequence of the attacks of the <i>Aphis</i>,
  then the proportion of <span class="pagenum" id="page585"><span
  class="smaller">{585}</span></span>winged individuals becomes large.<a id="NtA_522"
  href="#Nt_522"><sup>[522]</sup></a> The appearance of winged individuals is frequently accompanied
  by a peculiar change of habit; the winged individuals migrating to another plant, which in many
  cases is of a totally different botanical nature from that on which the apterous broods were
  reared: for instance <i>Aphis mali</i>, after producing several apterous generations on apple,
  gives rise to winged individuals that migrate to the stems of corn or grass, and feeding thereon
  commence another cycle of generations. The study of this sort of Aphis-migration is chiefly
  modern, but many very curious facts have already been brought to light; thus <i>Drepanosiphum
  platanoides</i>, after producing a certain number of viviparous generations on maple
  (<i>Acer</i>), quits this food-plant for another, but after two or three months returns again to
  the maple, and produces sexual young that lay eggs.<a id="NtA_523"
  href="#Nt_523"><sup>[523]</sup></a> Histories such as this are rather common. Even more
  interesting are the cases of those species that, after some weeks of physiological activity on a
  plant, pass into a state of repose on the same plant, and then after some weeks produce sexual
  young. On the whole, it would appear that the appearance of winged forms is a concomitant of
  decreasing nutrition. It is a very remarkable fact that the sexually perfect females are
  invariably apterous, and this is frequently also the case with the males. It is also highly
  remarkable that the sexually perfect individuals are of comparatively small size. There are at
  least three kinds of males in Aphidae&mdash;1, winged males; 2, wingless males with mouth well
  developed; 3, wingless small males with mouth absent. As regards some of these points the
  conditions usual in Insect life are reversed.<a id="NtA_524" href="#Nt_524"><sup>[524]</sup></a>
  Huxley inclined to treat all these products of a fertilised egg, that are antecedent to another
  process of gamogenesis (<i>i.e.</i> production with fertilisation), as one zoological individual:
  in that case the Aphis zoological individual is winged before attaining the mature state, and is
  wingless and smaller when mature. Some species may have as a rule two, others three, winged
  generations in a year.</p>

  <p><b>Parallel series.</b>&mdash;In certain cases individuals of one generation assume different
  habits, and so set up the phenomenon known as parallel series. This has been recently investigated
  in the genus <i>Chermes</i> by Blochmann, Dreyfus, and Cholodkovsky. This latter savant informs
  us<a id="NtA_525" href="#Nt_525"><sup>[525]</sup></a> that a wingless parthenogenetic female of
  <i>Chermes</i> hibernates on a fir-tree&mdash;<i>Picea excelsa</i>&mdash;and in the spring lays
  numerous eggs; these hatch, and by the effects of suction of the <i>Chermes</i> on the young
  shoots, galls are formed (Fig. 286), in which the Insects are found in large numbers; when they
  have grown the galls open, and allowing the Insects to escape these moult and become winged
  females. They now take on different habits; some of them remain on the <i>Picea</i>, lay their
  eggs thereon, and out of these there are produced young that grow into hibernating females, which
  next spring produce galls as their grandmothers did; but another portion migrates to the Larch
  (<i>Larix</i>); here eggs are laid, from which proceed wingless parthenogenetic females, that
  hibernate on their new or secondary plant, and in the following spring lay their eggs and give
  rise to a dimorphic generation, part of them becoming nymphs and going on to the winged condition,
  while the other part remain wingless and lay eggs, that give rise to yet another wingless
  generation; in fact, a second pair of parallel series is formed on the new plant, of which one is
  wingless, and exclusively parthenogenetic, and continues to live in this fashion for an indefinite
  period on the secondary plant, while the other part becomes winged; these latter are called
  sexuparous, and go back to the <i>Picea</i>, and there lay eggs, that give rise to the sexual
  forms. If we would summarise these facts with a view to remembering them, we may say that a
  migration of a part of a generation from the <i>Picea</i> was made with a view of producing a
  sexual generation, but that only a portion of the migrants succeeded in effecting the object of
  the migration, and this only in their third generation. Thus portions remained on the
  <i>Picea</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page587"><span
  class="smaller">{587}</span></span>producing unisexual (female) individuals, and a portion of
  those that emigrated to the <i>Larix</i> remained thereon, producing also unisexual (female)
  individuals, while the others returned to the <i>Picea</i> and produced a sexual generation. How
  long the production of the unisexual generations may continue has not been determined.</p>

  <p><i>Phylloxera.</i>&mdash;The <i>Phylloxera</i>, that has caused such an enormous amount of
  damage in the Old World during the last thirty years, is a small Aphid that was introduced from
  North America into Europe. In North America it is not so injurious as it is in Europe, owing, no
  doubt, to slight distinctions in the conditions of life in the two hemispheres, as one of which
  may be mentioned that in Europe a larger proportion of the individuals produced appear to confine
  themselves to feeding on the roots, <i>P. vastatrix</i> being one of the species that lives both
  in galls on leaves, and underground on the roots. The species is one that exhibits in their most
  complex form the peculiar phenomena of Aphid life we have already mentioned. It has probably only
  one congener, <i>Phylloxera quercus</i>, and of this Lichtenstein says that in its cycle, from the
  starting-point of the winter-egg to the assumption of the sexual condition, it exhibits a series
  of no less than twenty-one forms.<a id="NtA_526" href="#Nt_526"><sup>[526]</sup></a> The life of
  <i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i> apparently differs essentially from what we have described in
  <i>Chermes</i>, inasmuch as the migrations are only between leaf and root of the same
  plant&mdash;the vine&mdash;and not from one species of plant to another. Some authorities treat
  <i>Phylloxera</i> and <i>Chermes</i> as a separate family under the name of Phylloxeridae.</p>

      small figure, to the left, is a section made at the level indicated by the pointing line
      <i>a</i>, and shows the chambers containing young.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Galls.</i>&mdash;Like <i>Phylloxera</i>, many species of Aphidae live partially, others
  wholly, in galls that are produced by plants as the result of one or more Aphids interfering with
  a delicate part of the plant when it is in a young and growing state. The usual position of Aphid
  galls is on a leaf or leaf-stalk. But in the case of the genus <i>Chermes</i>, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page588"><span class="smaller">{588}</span></span>a bud or some growing part
  of the spruce-fir is affected in such a way that it gives rise to an object having externally the
  appearance of a little fir-cone, while inside it consists of chambers in which the Aphids reside.
  The forms of Aphid-galls are very diverse, but this is probably due to the plant rather than to
  the Insect, for the same species of Aphis may give rise to different forms of galls. R&eacute;aumur
  thought that each Aphid-gall was due to a single individual that irritated the tissue of the
  plant, so that the latter grew up at the point of irritation and enclosed the Insect.</p>

  <p>A few points as to the anatomy of Aphids should be noticed. It is doubtful whether the antennae
  have ever really more than six joints, the apparent seventh joint being actually a sort of
  appendage of the sixth. The rostrum is externally three-jointed, and is remarkable for the great
  diversity in its length, sometimes it is quite short, at others several times longer than the body
  (Fig. 285); the setae are often very much longer than the sheath; in cases where this great length
  of rostrum exists, the individual may often be found with the tip firmly fixed in the bark, and,
  as it were, tethered by means of the rostrum, the length of which allows, nevertheless,
  considerable locomotion. Suction is performed by contractions of the pharynx. There has been much
  difference of opinion as to whether there is a salivary syringe, and Witlaczil failed to find it.
  Krassilstschik is, however, positive that it exists,<a id="NtA_527"
  href="#Nt_527"><sup>[527]</sup></a> and that it is analogous to that described by Mayer in
  <i>Pyrrhocoris</i>, but there are great differences of structure between the two. It is very
  difficult to determine the number of segments at the extremity of the body; this is terminated
  dorsally by a median organ placed above the anus, and known as the cauda. Balbiani apparently
  considers that there are ten abdominal segments and the cauda. The alimentary canal has a small
  stomach, and an elongate intestine, the terminal division of which is capacious and remarkably
  long. There are no Malpighian tubes; according to Kowalevsky, their function is discharged by the
  posterior part of the alimentary canal. There exists, however, a peculiar structure, the
  pseudovitellus, a sort of cellular, double string; and Witlaczil, in his valuable paper<a
  id="NtA_528" href="#Nt_528"><sup>[528]</sup></a> on the anatomy of Aphidae, suggests that this
  <span class="pagenum" id="page589"><span class="smaller">{589}</span></span>organ may in some way
  replace the missing Malpighian tubes. Another highly peculiar structure is the siphons, frequently
  called nectaries, honey-tubes, or siphuncles. They are situated on the dorsal aspect of the fifth
  abdominal segment, but exist only in certain of the sub-families; they are of very different
  lengths according to the species, and are capable of movement; they open directly into the body
  cavity, though exceptional openings into the body cavity are extremely rare in Insects. They
  excrete a waxy matter, which first appears as oil-like globules. It was formerly supposed that
  they were the means of secreting the sugary matter, called honey-dew, so much prized by ants and
  some other Insects; but this is now ascertained to be erroneous. This matter comes from the
  alimentary canal, and is secreted in large quantities by some species, B&uuml;sgen having observed that
  forty-eight drops, each about 1 mm. in diameter, were emitted by a single individual in
  twenty-four hours.<a id="NtA_529" href="#Nt_529"><sup>[529]</sup></a> Certain gall-dwelling
  Aphidae&mdash;<i>Pemphigus</i>, <i>Chermes</i> (Fig. 285), <i>Schizoneura</i>&mdash;possess
  numerous wax glands; these seem to replace the siphons, and excrete the peculiar, whitish
  flocculent matter that is so conspicuous in some of these Aphids.</p>

  <p>Earlier anatomists failed to find any dorsal vessel, and it is consequently reported in books
  to be absent. It has been, however, recently detected by Witlaczil, and Mordwilko states that it
  does not differ from that of other Insects.</p>

  <p>We have already alluded to the fact that the mode of reproduction of Aphids leads to an
  unrivalled increase. This, however, is not due to the prolificness of the individual, which, in
  point of fact, appears to be considerably below the average in Insects, but rather to the rapidity
  with which the young begin to reproduce. This has been discussed by Huxley, Buckton, and others.
  The first-named naturalist calculated that the produce of a single <i>Aphis</i> would, in the
  course of ten generations, supposing all the individuals to survive, "contain more ponderable
  substance than five hundred millions of stout men; that is, more than the whole population of
  China."<a id="NtA_530" href="#Nt_530"><sup>[530]</sup></a> It has since been contended that
  Professor Huxley's calculation was much below the mark. Although it is somewhat difficult to make
  a calculation dealing adequately with the actual facts, yet it is clear that the increase <span
  class="pagenum" id="page590"><span class="smaller">{590}</span></span>of Aphids is such that,
  drawing as they do their nutriment directly from the plant in its growing state, in the course of
  two or three years there would be no nutriment available for other animals, except such as might
  be derived from plants not attacked by Aphids. The numbers of Aphidae would be so great that they
  could not be expressed by ordinary numerical methods, and their increase would be actually limited
  only by the relations existing between different kinds of plants, and between plants and Aphids.
  This result is avoided by the fact that Aphids are themselves the victims of a whole army of
  Insect enemies. They have the numerous members of a special group (Braconidae, Aphidiides) of
  minute Hymenoptera to live inside their bodies, and many Aculeate Hymenoptera depend entirely on
  the Aphidae as the source of food for their own progeny. The
  Lady-birds&mdash;Coccinellidae&mdash;live on Aphids and Coccids, and themselves increase to such
  an extent as to be in many years a conspicuous part of the Insect world. Crowds of the larvae of
  Hemerobiids and Syrphids are constantly engaged in spearing and sucking the Aphides. Hence the old
  naturalist Bonnet said that, just as we sow grain for our benefit, Nature has sown Aphids for the
  benefit of multitudes of different Insects. He might have added that these different Insects are
  for the benefit of man, it being clear that without them the population of the world must rapidly
  decrease.</p>

  <p>Ants treat Aphidae more intelligently than most other Insects do, for they do not destroy the
  helpless creatures, but utilise their products in the way man does those of the cows he keeps. The
  relations between ants and Aphids is itself an extensive chapter in Natural History; many facts
  have been brought to light showing that the ants manage the Aphids in a prudent or intelligent
  manner, distributing them when too numerous in one place, keeping guard over them, even building
  shelters for them, and in some cases keeping them in direct association, by retaining the Aphids
  in their own dwellings. The further investigation of these points goes, the more it tends to raise
  the actions of the ants to the level we call in ourselves intelligent. It would even appear that
  the ants are acquainted with the migrations of the Aphids from one species of plant to another,
  Webster informing us that as the Aphis-population on an apple tree multiplied the ants in
  attendance anticipated their migration to wheat and grass <span class="pagenum" id="page591"><span
  class="smaller">{591}</span></span>by carrying them to those plants.<a id="NtA_531"
  href="#Nt_531"><sup>[531]</sup></a> We have nearly 200 species of Aphidae in Britain,<a
  id="NtA_532" href="#Nt_532"><sup>[532]</sup></a> and there may perhaps be 800 known altogether. To
  what extent they may occur in the tropics is undetermined. There are said to be no native species
  in New Zealand.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Aleurodidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Minute Insects, with four mealy wings, seven-jointed
  antennae, two-jointed feet, terminated by two claws and a third process.</i> These minute Insects
  are at present a source of considerable perplexity, owing to the curious nature of their
  metamorphosis, and the contradictory accounts given of them. In the earlier stages they are
  scale-like and quiescent, being fixed to the under side of a leaf. The French authors Signoret and
  Girard state that the young are hatched having visible appendages and segmentation, but that after
  they are attached to the leaf the organs gradually suffer atrophy. Maskell states the opposite,
  saying that the organs in the earliest stages are not usually recognisable, but become faintly
  visible with the growth of the Insect. Heeger states that the larva undergoes three ecdyses, and
  he gives the figures we reproduce; if he be correct it would appear that the nymph undergoes a
  great development. R&eacute;aumur, on account apparently of their great metamorphosis, treated the
  species <span class="pagenum" id="page592"><span class="smaller">{592}</span></span>known to him
  as being Lepidopterous, though he correctly pointed out their distinctions. At present we can only
  conclude that the Aleurodidae undergo a metamorphosis of a kind peculiar to themselves, and
  requiring renewed investigation. The family has been monographed by Signoret, and more recently by
  Maskell, who has increased the number of species to about sixty.<a id="NtA_533"

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Coccidae</b> (<i>Scale-Insects</i>, <i>Mealy-bugs</i>).&mdash;<i>Insects, usually
  minute, with only a single claw to the foot; the male with one pair of wings, but without
  mouth-parts; the female wingless and usually so degraded in form that most of the external organs
  and appendages cannot be distinguished.</i> The form in which these Insects are most generally
  known is that of a small scale or shell-like body closely adhering to leaves, fruits, or bark. The
  scales are of the most varied form, so that no general description can be given of them. The scale
  may be defined as an accumulation of excreted matter, combined with the cast skin or skins of the
  Insect, covering the body either totally or partially, and thus acting as a shield under which the
  subsequent development takes place. All Coccidae do not form scales; but the habit of excreting a
  large quantity of peculiar matters to the outside of the body is universal; this excreted
  substance is frequently white, and of a powdery nature, and Coccids of this kind are known as
  mealy-bugs. In other cases the exudation is like shell or glass, and the creature may become quite
  encysted therein. In this way the forms of Cocidae known as "ground-pearls" are formed. When first
  hatched from the egg Coccidae are mite-like creatures, and it is only subsequently that the
  females lose the power of locomotion. The females of numerous forms of Coccidae&mdash;more
  particularly the mealy-bugs&mdash;do not lose the antennae and legs. There is also a group
  (Brachyscelides) of Coccids that live in <span class="pagenum" id="page593"><span
  class="smaller">{593}</span></span>galls. This highly aberrant group is, however, peculiar to
  Australia; elsewhere very few gall-making Coccids have been discovered.</p>

  <p>There are upwards of 800 species of Coccidae at present known.<a id="NtA_534"
  href="#Nt_534"><sup>[534]</sup></a> The family was monographed by Signoret about twenty-five years
  ago, and since then there has been very much matter concerning them published in a scattered
  manner.<a id="NtA_535" href="#Nt_535"><sup>[535]</sup></a> No general work has been published on
  the British species, but Mr. Newstead is preparing one. The classification of Insects so minute as
  Coccidae, and with such extreme difference in the sexes, is, of course, a matter of great
  difficulty; the best divisions are those given by Green in his <i>Coccidae of Ceylon</i>.<a
  id="NtA_536" href="#Nt_536"><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The fact that there is only one pair of wings in the perfect male Coccid would appear to ally
  these Insects with the Diptera; these Coccidae have, too, like the Diptera, a small appendage on
  each side of the metathorax. Witlaczil shows that these little processes may really represent a
  pair of wings, inasmuch as they are developed from imperfect folds of hypodermis, <i>i.e.</i>
  imaginal discs. Beyond these facts and the occurrence in certain females (Margarodes) of a great
  histolysis during the post-embryonic development, there is nothing to indicate any relationship
  between Coccidae and Diptera. It has been shown by Riley that these little processes, in some
  forms, serve as hooks to attach or control the true wings, and this function is never assumed by
  the halteres of Diptera. Although Coccidae are placed next Aphidae, yet the two families appear to
  be really very different. The modes of reproduction so peculiar in Aphidae reappear to a certain
  extent in Coccidae, but are associated with profound <span class="pagenum" id="page594"><span
  class="smaller">{594}</span></span>distinctions. Though the viviparous method of reproduction and
  parthenogenesis occur in Coccidae, yet they are only exceptional, and they are not put to the same
  uses by the species that exhibit the phenomena. Thus we have seen that in Aphidae generations of
  imperfect individuals are produced with rapidity, while the individual is not directly very
  prolific. In Coccidae the reverse is the case&mdash;the generations are usually similar to one
  another; they do not, as a rule, follow with rapidity, and the female is usually very prolific,
  thousands of young being sometimes produced by a single individual. The extraordinary polymorphism
  of the species of Aphidae is not exhibited by Coccidae, though, contrary to what we find in
  Aphidae, the males and females are usually excessively different. The two families apparently also
  differ in that Coccidae are specially characteristic of warm climates, Aphidae of the temperate
  regions.</p>

  <p><b>Parthenogenesis.</b>&mdash;Owing to the fact that the males are very minute creatures,
  totally different from the females, and living but a very short time, they were but little known
  to the earlier observers. It was therefore only natural to suppose that parthenogenesis was very
  common. Of late years the males of a great many species have become known, so that ordinary sexual
  reproduction must be considered as the normal method in Coccidae, although, in the great majority
  of cases, the male is still unknown. It has, however, been shown in numerous cases that
  parthenogenesis may occur even when males exist; and there are some abundant species of which it
  has not been possible to find a male. In 1887 Moniez<a id="NtA_537"
  href="#Nt_537"><sup>[537]</sup></a> announced that he had discovered the male of <i>Lecanium
  hesperidum</i> (one of the notoriously parthenogenetic species) in an ovarian cul-de-sac in the
  body of the female, and he therefore considers that sexual reproduction occurs. He does not say
  how pairing takes place, and we are not aware that his observation has been confirmed. If correct
  it will be necessary to reconsider the whole question as to parthenogenesis in Coccidae. Apterous
  males are known in two or three species.</p>

  <p>The post-embryonic development of Coccidae is of the most unusual character. It is quite
  different in the two sexes, and in each of them it presents features not found elsewhere. It has,
  however, as yet been studied in only a few forms, and even in them is incompletely known.</p>

  <p>When hatched from the egg the young Coccids are all similar, male and female being
  indistinguishable. A difference soon appears, with the result that the male, after passing through
  more than one pupal condition, appears as a winged Insect. The female never becomes winged, but,
  if we may judge from the incomplete accounts we at present possess, her development varies much
  according to species. In some she retains the legs, antennae, and mouth-organs; in others she
  loses these parts, though retaining the original form in a general manner; while in a third
  (<i>Margarodes</i>) she becomes encysted, and apparently suffers an almost complete histolysis,
  reappearing after a very long period (it is said it may be as much as seven years) in a
  considerably altered form. The post-embryonic development of <i>Aspidiotus nerii</i> has been
  studied by Schmidt<a id="NtA_538" href="#Nt_538"><sup>[538]</sup></a> and Witlaczil,<a
  id="NtA_539" href="#Nt_539"><sup>[539]</sup></a> whose accounts agree except as to some points,
  such as the number of ecdyses. The young, or larva, is hatched with fairly well-developed legs,
  antennae, and rostrum; there is no external difference between the sexes. The larva selects some
  spot on the plant and drives its rostrum therein, thus becoming fixed; moults occur, and the body
  excretes waxy matter from its sides in processes that fell together and form the shield; the
  female becomes much larger than the male. The legs and antennae of both sexes disappear, so that
  the power of movement is completely lost. The mouth-parts also atrophy. The female after this
  undergoes no further change, except that of growth in connection with ovarian development.</p>

  <p>The male, however, continues development; notwithstanding the impossibility of taking food,
  owing to the absence of a mouth, it increases much in size, and the organs of the future perfect
  Insect commence to develop from imaginal discs in a manner similar to that which occurs in the
  Dipterous genus <i>Corethra</i>; no mouth-parts are however developed, these being merely
  represented by spots of pigment, or rudimentary additional eyes. The wings are developed outside
  the body. Difference of opinion prevails as to the nature of the instars between the young larva
  and the imago. It is clear, however, that Fig. 291, D, corresponds fairly with the pupa of Insects
  with complete metamorphosis, and the instars shown in Fig. 291, B, C, may therefore be looked on
  as equivalents of the resting-larva stage of ordinary Insects with complete metamorphosis.
  Witlaczil considers this development to be a condition of incomplete, approaching very nearly to
  complete, metamorphosis. The condition is perhaps more precisely estimated if we recollect that
  winged Insects are divided into two series, in one of which the wings are developed outside the
  body; in the other, inside the body. The Insects with very complete metamorphosis all belong to
  the second of these two series, while in the male Coccid we have the highest form of metamorphosis
  attained by any of the first series. As regards the development of the female encysted nymph or
  pupa, previously alluded to as being found in the "ground-pearls" of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page597"><span class="smaller">{597}</span></span>the genus <i>Margarodes</i>, we can at
  present offer the reader no satisfactory account.<a id="NtA_540"

  <p><b>Products of Coccidae.</b>&mdash;Honey-dew is secreted by Coccidae, but as a rule not so
  extensively as by Aphidae and some other Homoptera; nevertheless, it is often sufficient to make
  the plants frequented by Coccids very sticky and unclean. Some species make a really extensive
  exudation of such matter. R&eacute;aumur records that a Coccid, which is doubtless <i>Lecanium
  persicae</i>, excretes a supply of honey-dew that drips to the ground; he says it tastes sweet and
  nice. The manna mentioned in the book of Exodus is pretty certainly the honey-dew secreted by
  <i>Coccus</i> (now <i>Gossyparia</i>) <i>mannifera</i>, which lives on <i>Tamarix</i> in many
  places in the Mediterranean basin. This substance is still called by the Arabs "Man," and is used
  as food; in its natural state it is a substance very like honey; it is doubtless excreted by the
  <i>Coccus</i>, and is not produced directly by the <i>Tamarix</i> as some have supposed. Waxy
  matters are produced by several Coccidae. <i>Ceroplastes ceriferus</i>, a Lecaniid, produces white
  wax in India. <i>Ceroplastes</i> is a widely distributed genus, and various species of it have
  been used for the purpose of producing wax in other parts of the world. The white wax of China is
  understood to be produced by another Lecaniid, <i>Ericerus pela</i>; but little is known as to
  this Insect; it is said that the wax is produced by the winged males. The substance was formerly
  greatly prized in China, but is falling into disuse on account of the introduction of Kerosene.
  Lac is produced by <i>Carteria lacca</i>, a Lecaniid living in India on <i>Anona squamosa</i>, as
  well as on species of <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Rhamnus</i> and other trees; the lac is the shelly scale
  produced by the Insect as a covering; it is composed in larger part of resinous matter, with which
  there is mixed a comparatively small quantity of wax and other substances. The body of this Insect
  also affords the red substance called lake. Various species of <i>Kermes</i> formerly afforded a
  red dye well known to the Greeks and Romans. These Insects live on <i>Quercus coccifera</i> in the
  Mediterranean region. A medicinal syrup is also obtained from them. <i>Porphyrophora polonica</i>
  was used in North and Central Europe for the same purposes as <i>Kermes</i>; it is a Coccid living
  on the roots of <i>Polygonum cocciferum</i>. These European Insects were replaced commercially
  <span class="pagenum" id="page598"><span class="smaller">{598}</span></span>after the discovery of
  America by the cochineal Insect, <i>Coccus cacti</i>, a Mexican Coccid feeding on a Cactus called
  Nopal (<i>Opuntia coccinellifera</i>). This Insect was subsequently introduced to the Eastern
  hemisphere, and was established with more or less success in a few spots on the borders of the
  Mediterranean. In the Canary Islands it flourished on other species of <i>Cactus</i>, became
  acclimatised, and was the object of an extensive commerce. The colour in the case of all these
  Coccid dyes was obtained from the bodies of the Insects, in the tissues of which it is contained.
  The dyes have now been largely displaced in commerce by the derivatives of Aniline. Axin is
  produced by the Mexican Coccid <i>Llaveia axinus</i>; this substance appears to be of a very
  peculiar nature; it is apparently chiefly fatty, and contains a peculiar acid, axinic acid. Axin
  is used as an external medicinal application in various affections; and it is also employed as a
  varnish; it dries and hardens on exposure to the air, and is said to be of considerable value.<a
  id="NtA_541" href="#Nt_541"><sup>[541]</sup></a> In our British genus <i>Orthezia</i> the body of
  the female is completely covered with a symmetrical snow-white armour, from which project the pink
  legs and antennae. This is one of the forms in which the female preserves the legs to the end of
  her life. The objects called ground-pearls, already alluded to, have long been known in various
  parts of the world, and in the island of St. Vincent they are sufficiently large to be collected
  and strung for necklaces. These bodies are the encysted pupae of Coccids of the genus
  <i>Margarodes</i>; the cyst is said to be of chitin. <i>M. vitis</i> commits serious ravages on
  the vines in Chili by sucking their roots, and it is probable that all the species are of
  subterranean habits; this would partially explain the fact that very little is known about the
  history of these pearls, though naturalists have been acquainted with them for many years.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The gall-making Coccids of the group Brachyscelides have only recently been at all
  investigated; the galls they give rise to are sometimes about a foot in length, and there appear
  to be numerous species and several genera in Australia; they are especially abundant on
  <i>Eucalyptus</i> and Acacias. The females are highly remarkable from the variable conditions the
  legs assume, so that in some cases they may be described as biped Insects, the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page599"><span class="smaller">{599}</span></span>hind legs remaining, though
  the others have atrophied.<a id="NtA_542" href="#Nt_542"><sup>[542]</sup></a> Very little indeed
  is known as to these Insects. One of the most peculiar points of their economy appears to be that
  the galls giving rise to males are different from those producing females.</p>

  <p><i>Small Insects with thin integument; entirely wingless, the three thoracic segments
  indistinctly separated; the head bearing in front a short tube furnished with hooks; from which
  tube there can be protruded another very delicate sucking-tube. Feet terminated by a single long
  claw.</i> The Anoplura, Pediculidae, or lice are disgusting Insects about which but little is
  known. The most contrary opinions have been expressed as to their mode of taking their
  nourishment, which is, without exception, the blood of Mammals; on the bodies of which they pass
  the whole of their life. It is a most difficult matter to examine their mouth; the best
  information on this point is given by Schi&ouml;dte and Graber, but though these two authorities agree,
  their results are very incomplete, and do not warrant us in expressing a confident opinion as to
  the nature of the relationship between Hemiptera and Anoplura&mdash;a question that has been for
  long a moot one. The short tube furnished with hooks in front (Fig. 293, <i>d</i>) is considered
  to be the lower lip, and the tube inside is, it is suggested, a combination of the homologues of
  maxillae and mandibles; there is also what may be a labrum (<i>g</i>); and inside the head a
  framework, at any rate analogous to if not homologous with, the parts of this kind we have
  described as existing in Hemiptera. All the parts, with the exception of the basal tube or head of
  the beak, are of the most minute and delicate nature, so that it is difficult to see their form or
  comprehend their relations. It is evident that they are very different anatomically from the
  mouth-parts of Hemiptera; still there is <span class="pagenum" id="page600"><span
  class="smaller">{600}</span></span>sufficient general resemblance to warrant the belief that the
  parts in the two may ultimately be shown to be also morphologically similar. If Meinert be
  correct, this view will, however, not prove to have any foundation. He considers that
  morphologically the mouth of the louse has no similarity to that of the bug; the protrusible parts
  in the former he considers to be modifications of epipharynx and hypopharynx; and the rod-like
  structures to be hypopharyngeal lamellae; and that they are thus totally different from the setae
  of bugs.<a id="NtA_543" href="#Nt_543"><sup>[543]</sup></a> He considers Lice to be a distinct
  Order of Insects for which he proposes the name Siphunculata.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal and nervous system resemble those of Mallophaga more than they do those of
  Hemiptera. The oesophagus leads into a large stomach bilobed in front; at the posterior extremity
  of this there open the four Malpighian tubes, and behind these there is a well-marked small
  intestine. The nervous system consists of a cephalic ganglion and of three other closely
  approximated ganglia, the posterior one the larger. It remains doubtful whether or not the first
  of these three ganglia is the infra-oesophageal one.<a id="NtA_544"

  <p>The species of lice, so far as known, are not numerous, some six genera and about forty species
  being all that are recorded; they occur on various kinds of mammals, including some that live in
  water. Seals have a genus, <i>Echinophthirius</i>, peculiar to them. Monkeys are specially liable
  to be affected by lice; the genus that chiefly occurs on them is <i>Pedicinus</i>, a very distinct
  one, in which there are only three instead of five joints to the antennae. Perhaps the most
  remarkable louse is <i>Haematomyzus elephantis</i>, that of the elephant; it has a long proboscis
  in front of the head. As a rule each species of louse is confined to one species of Mammalia, or
  to very closely allied forms. Man is said to be infested <span class="pagenum" id="page601"><span
  class="smaller">{601}</span></span>by three species, <i>Pediculus capitis</i>, <i>P.
  vestimenti</i> and <i>Phthirius inguinalis</i>; Meinert is of opinion that <i>P. capitis</i> and
  <i>P. vestimenti</i> are only one species, and Schi&ouml;dte appears also to have thought this
  probable. Andrew Murray was of opinion that the heads of different varieties of men are infested
  by distinct varieties of <i>P. capitis</i>. His conclusion was chiefly based on examination of
  specimens preserved by Charles Darwin; it requires confirmation. Very little is known as to the
  life-history of the louse. Leeuwenhoek made himself the <i>corpus vile</i> for an experiment, from
  which he concluded that the <i>Pediculus vestimenti</i> is very prolific. That scientific men did
  not know whether the louse bites or sucks was formerly made the ground for a taunt. Schi&ouml;dte has
  given an almost pleasing account of the way in which he settled this,<a id="NtA_545"
  href="#Nt_545"><sup>[545]</sup></a> showing that the sucking action is beyond all doubt. Accounts
  of disease called Phthiriasis, attributed to lice, are to be found in many old books, but the
  evidence does not warrant us in believing anything more than that persons suffering from some
  disease, and in a neglected and filthy condition, were horribly infested with these disgusting
  Insects.</p>

  <p class="sp5">It is usual to say that Pediculidae are Hemiptera degraded by a long exclusive
  persistence in parasitic habits. At present, however, this must be looked on as a pious opinion,
  rather than as an induction from our knowledge of their morphology and embryology; for this is at
  present too imperfect to warrant any final conclusion.</p>

    <p><i>Pelopaeus</i> disappears from the new catalogue of Hymenoptera as the name of a valid

    <p>When a second cell is more or less perfectly marked out, the cell with which it is connected

    "incomplete" is mentioned.</p>

    <p>In this sub-family there are numerous forms in which the elytra cover the pygidium, and in
    which the number of conspicuous ventral segments is reduced to five or even four. We use the
    term Coprides as equivalent to the "Laparosticti" of Lacordaire (<i>Gen. Col.</i> iii. 1856); it

    <p>It seems impossible to understand the morphology of the anterior segments by mere inspection;
    the anterior spiracle being seated on the segment behind the broad thorax. Considerable
    difference of opinion has prevailed as to what is head, what thorax; the aid of embryology is
    necessary to settle the point. The larva described by Westwood (<i>Mod. Classif.</i> i. 1839, p.
    229), and figured as probably <i>Buprestis attenuata</i> is doubtless a Passalid.</p>

    148; and for the larvae F. M&uuml;ller, <i>Arch. Mus. Rio-Jan.</i> iv. 1881, p. 47.  The name
    "Liponeuridae" was formerly applied by some authorities to this family, but it is now generally
    recognised that Blepharoceridae is more legitimate.</p>

    <p>There is some doubt on this point, as the earlier observers seem to have supposed that a
    winged individual appearing in a generation chiefly apterous was <i>ipso facto</i>, a male; it
    seems, however, to be certain that perfect winged males appear in some species in generations
    producing no perfect sexual females. Speaking generally, the course of events seems to be that
    in summer there exist only wingless and winged parthenogenetic females, and that the sexually
    perfect forms appear for the first time in autumn.</p>
